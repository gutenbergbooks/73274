CAÑON HONANKI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOVE a timbered valley in the southwest
rises a towering wall of gorgeous cliffs
such as only Arizona can produce. Their
rock pinnacles are banded with color—red strata,
ochre, blue, green, and white—all in wavy horizontal
lines like layer cake. These long walls were scoured
clean and smooth long ago by prehistoric water
action. They were broken with deep fissures—fissures
that now cleave the cliff from top to bottom—“chimneys”
that mean seven hundred feet of sheer
ascent to him who would dare scale these heights.</p>

<p>Two riders sat gazing up, searching this cliff face,
while an Airedale dog of huge and leonine aspect
prowled about in the creek bottom near them, investigating
this and that with snuffing nose.</p>

<p>“That cliff dwelling is up here somewhere, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
to Doctor Fewkes’ map, John,” said the smaller
and rangier of the pair, his puckered-up black eyes
never leaving off their scrutiny of the cliff face.
“Think we’ll find her?”</p>

<p>The older man, a great, bony and leathery cowman,
who might have hailed from anywhere in the
west from Montana to Arizona, took off his sombrero
and mopped a sweaty brow with the loose
end of his bandanna.</p>

<p>“Search me!” he grinned. “I’m a cowman, not no
prophet—as the greenhorn axman said when the
lumber boss as’t him which way his tree was goin’
to fall.” He looked lugubriously up at the cliff,
shaking his head solemnly. “It’d take a horned toad
with suckers on his feet to bust her, Siddy son.”</p>

<p>The youth tugged determinedly at the fine fuzz
of black mustache that adorned his upper lip. “Honanki
Ruins or bust—that’s our motto, John!” he
retorted, his black eyes twinkling merrily at the
reluctant cowman. “Here’s Fewkes’ map, with the
ruins marked ‘Inaccessible’ on it, and, by jerry, <i>we’re</i>
here, if the map’s right. They’re somewhere above
us, and it’s up to us to bust ’em.”</p>

<p>“Yaas,” said Big John, shifting his weight to the
nigh stirrup to give the white horse under him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
change of load. “Somethin’ hed orter be done about
it, thet’s shore! <i>You</i> mosey up—an’ I’ll hold yore
hoss!”</p>

<p>All of which preliminaries usually meant that Big
John really meant to take the lead in climbing himself
once the ruins were found. Sid knew that all
this feigned reluctance about climbing cliffs was
mere camouflage on Big John’s part. He urged his
pinto across the cañon so as to get a better view of
the cliff face. He wanted to size up that cañon
wall first, for he knew that the only way to keep Big
John off that cliff was to tie him down, which “ain’t
done.” The two had been boon comrades for a long
time; first up in Montana on the hunt for the Ring-Necked
Grizzly, later in the Cañon de Chelly region
where the Black Panther of the Navaho had met his
end. That expedition had been Sid’s start in practical
ethnology. Now they were down in the White
River reservation of the Apache, seeking out ruins
that had been noted by Dr. Fewkes of the Smithsonian
but had been left unexplored for lack of time
and facilities.</p>

<p>“There it is!” rang out the youth’s voice excitedly
from across Cañon Honanki (Bear Cañon). “Come
over here, John!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>The huge cowman trotted his white mustang over
to where Sid had halted his pinto under a big western
pine. Far up, at least three hundred feet above the
floor of the valley, they saw holes like swallow’s
nests pierced in the cliff at irregular intervals. They
seemed small and round and black as ink, and near
them were carved on the rock odd circular spirals,
lightning zigzags, primitive horses, apparently all
legs, and geometrical armed-and-legged designs intended
to represent men. Ragged holes further
along on the cliff face showed that galleries
and passageways ran in behind the living rock up
there. These natural caves, common enough in
Arizona, had been scoured out by water action in
geologic times.</p>

<p>But it was a fearful place for human beings to
attempt to climb to! Tall perpendicular folds in the
cliff face cast their black shadows on the surrounding
stone, the cracks beginning and ending nowhere.
There were impracticable clefts, ledges that shaded
off to flat precipice faces, dents and scoriations not
over two feet deep, yet they seemed to be all the
footholds for climbing that the place afforded.</p>

<p>“Gorry!—a cavate dwelling!” whooped Sid, overjoyed.
“The kind that is built in the solid rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
instead of being made of stone slabs, John,” he explained
with the ethnologist’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Big John grinned. “Gawsh!” he exploded. “I
s’pose that humans once tried to live in such places—but
eagles would know better! Nawthin’ll do but
we gotto bust her, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yep,” said Sid confidently. “A shaman or a
pueblo priest lived up there once. Sort of hermit,
you know. Holy man. If that old scout <i>lived</i> there
we ought to be able to climb up <i>once</i>.—What think?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t come pilgriming down to shoot up
the gulch <i>muy</i> plentiful, I’m bettin’!” averred Big
John sardonically. “I’ll tell ye, Sid; thar’s only one
way to bust her, and that’s to make a string of long
ladders, same as <i>he</i> done. You don’t get me off
this hoss on no fly-creepin’ climb without a-doin’
jest that—savvy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder!” exclaimed Sid impatiently. “It’d
take two days of perishing work. Le’s try to get
up this cleft here.” He pointed to the beginnings
of a practical ascent.</p>

<p>“No!” barked Big John, and his tone was final.
“The Colonel, yore pappy, he’d stake me out an’
build a fire on me tummy ef I let ye do any sech
thing. Thet halter’s still waitin’ for you, Sid, I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
admit, to save having it proved on me, but I ain’t
aimin’ to cheat your friends out of their necktie
party none. We camps right here an’ does the job
proper, sabe, lil’ hombre?”</p>

<p>Sid acquiesced, after a little further study of the
cliff. There was a tall vertical cleft that led up to
the swallow’s nest holes by a series of breaks and
rises. It was easy to reconstruct the old shaman’s
route by imagining the proper ladders set up so as
to negotiate a number of these vertical rises. They
could be made of slender lodgepole pine, with the
branches left on for steps in place of the heavier
logs with notched steps which the aborigines had
used. And not over half a dozen of them would
be needed altogether. It was worth doing, to “bust”
an “Inaccessible.”</p>

<p>Making camp in that rainless country was a
simple matter. Sid simply selected a pleasant site
on a knoll down the cañon overlooking the brook
under a canopy of huge pines, while Big John unsaddled
both horses and took them to the nearest
grass plot, staking them out and leaving Blaze, his
Airedale, on guard. The dog had been a present
from Colonel Colvin after the Black Panther trip.
He had the noted sagacity of his breed, and with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
year’s hunting experience with Ruler, the giant
coonhound of that expedition, had become a most
devoted and dependable “pardner” on all their hunts.
After merely piling the sleeping and cooking gear
and hanging up their food bags above the rodent
zone, Sid was ready to go ladder cutting.</p>

<p>The White Mountain region is pine forest,
sparsely timbered, the trees not crowded or packed
so densely as in eastern forest growth. As a result,
the mountains, which resemble much the rounded
and rolling Alleghanies of the east, seem stippled
with individual trees instead of banked in mossy
green as with closely growing timber. In the river
valleys, however, there are thickets as dense as in
any well watered clime, so Sid lost no time in getting
into such a pine grove armed with his light
belt ax. That light, little long-handled ax of his
was far more efficient than any sort of hatchet. It
would drop a four-inch pole thirty feet high almost
as quickly as a full ax.</p>

<p>Before the first tree crashed down Big John had
joined him.</p>

<p>“This here <i>Pinus Contorta</i> (sounds like Julius
Seizher only it ain’t) is the boy that will bust her
quick, Siddy boy,” he laughed, rolling up his sleeves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and baring a forearm like a lean ham. “You give
a leetle feller like me elbowroom!” He took a full
ax in one fist and smote a tree with it like chopping
with a hatchet. About two judgmatical cuts sufficed
to send it crashing down, whereat the giant cowman
started after another. Sid saw that he would have
his hands full just trimming the felled ones so he
went for their boughs with his small ax.</p>

<p>“You cut off them tops whar’ there’s somethin’
substantial to it, Sid,” rang out Big John’s voice
from the timber as he sent another pine tumbling
about the youth’s ears. “Remember that I weigh a
pound or two more’n a straw hat, son!”</p>

<p>“Help me put up this first one, now, John, she’s
ready,” announced Sid, struggling to lift the trunk
clear of the underbrush. Big John came over and
heaved the whole tree unceremoniously up on his
shoulder. With Sid guiding the lean end they made
for the cliff. Pushing and panting they up-ended it
and stood it ladderwise in a vertical fissure which
gave on a ledge above. Sid swarmed up the short
branch stubs, climbed out on the ledge, and waved
his arms down to Big John below.</p>

<p>“Looks like one of us’d have to shinny up and
haul the next one with a lariat,” he called down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Son, I got an idee—ef she don’t get away while
I’m picketin’ her down,” said Big John. “You git
up thar and hang my lariat honda over that point
of rock, sabe, an’ then we’ll run yore lariat through
the honda and snake up the next pole by one of the
hosses.”</p>

<p>He got both lariats up from camp while Sid
waited. Presently he returned, to cast it up with
the sure whirling pitch of the born rope artist. Sid
snatched it in and hauled his own up by the end of
the other. Then he coiled both, attached them to his
belt and started up the next cleft. The very pockets
in the rock where feet of the ancient log ladders used
to rest were easy to pick out as he climbed. What
men had done a man could do! By the time he had
everything fixed and the honda, or brass eye of the
lariat, hung with the other rove through it, Big John
was below with a horse and a fresh pole. It came
snaking up as the cowman led the horse away, hauling
on the lower end by the lariat tied to a cinch
strap above the pony’s back.</p>

<p>Sid set the pole and climbed higher to the next
ledge so that they could repeat the maneuver with a
third pole. This was the limit for that horse-hoisting
stunt, however, for he was now up over eighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
feet and there was not rope enough in camp to
double through the next honda. Big John yelled up
as he tied on the fourth pole and then he led the
horse back to graze again.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Sid saw him climbing up below
him. He had no fear of height himself. That all
belongs to the tenderfoot aloft for the first time.
It attacks man in a sickening sort of stage fright
at first, whether on cliff, high building, or the upper
rigging of a ship. After a time familiarity wears
it off and in its place there comes a cheerfulness
over the immense outlook, the height and the distant
scenery of it all; a joyous sense of freedom that
must be part of the bird’s outlook on life. He
waited for Big John on the ledge, looking about him
interestedly. It was narrow but not dangerous up
here. An old woman might have wanted a rail
fence or something, he thought, but things were
done on such a huge scale on this cliff that this very
ledge that looked from below like a mere trace
proved up here to be nearly three feet wide. Plenty!—Thousands!
as the facetious Big John would have
said.</p>

<p>Presently that cheerful son of Montana arrived,
breathing heavily but entirely at ease. “Waal, son,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
it ain’t goin’ to freeze up an’ snow on our scheme
jest yit! Tail on to this yere lariat and we’ll yank
up another pole.”</p>

<p>They hauled away on the long rope which the
cowman had tied to the butt of the fourth pole
while down there. It weighed perhaps fifty pounds—nothing
at all to mountain men! After a period
of grunting effort the butt end came up over the
ledge and the pole was gathered in and laid lengthwise.
They then started on to prospect for the next
fissure.</p>

<p>“Gosh durn it, how come, son? Hyar be stone
steps leadin’ up back hyar, or you can steal my hoss!”
came back Big John’s voice in the lead as they
rounded the face of the huge pinnacle of rock. Sid
hurried to catch up. That simplified matters a whole
lot!</p>

<p>“Look yonder, John!” he cried excitedly, as they
climbed up the row of stone pockets, “one more
pole finishes us! See that hole in the wall across
the crevasse?”</p>

<p>“Sho’ I do! But Sid, you ought to show some
respect for the naked truth, son—which-same
means we’re <i>busted</i>! Yore hole’s across a no-bottomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
chasm, hombre, an’ we ain’t flies nor yit
eagles, nohow!”</p>

<p>Sid climbed more notched steps that led up over a
smooth billow of rock and then eyed the hole opposite,
measuring the distance carefully. Here, evidently,
began those scoured-out caves and tunnels
in the living rock which led up to the cavate dwelling.
There had been a log bridge across here once, but
it had long since rotted through and perished.</p>

<p>“Let’s drop our fourth pole across and then,
we’ve got her, John—that’s the answer!” declared
Sid.</p>

<p>Big John shook his head solemnly. “Ef she
breaks an’ lets this gent down, they ain’t goin’ to be
no come-back, that’s sartain! No sir, nawthin’
stirring!”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks—where’s that pole, John? Le’s get
her up here and let her fall over anyhow!” exclaimed
Sid hopefully. “Maybe we can hit the hole opposite
with its other end.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try that much,” agreed Big John. “I ain’t
purty but I’m shore strong—as the bohunk said
when they as’t him to tote a saw log.” And without
more ado he retraced his steps and picked up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
pole. With it on his shoulder he came teetering
along the ledge.</p>

<p>“Thar, Sid—miss an’ out! We got jest one
shot,” he grunted, standing the pole up and aiming
its fall carefully.</p>

<p>“Wait!” shouted Sid. “Tie the lariat to the middle
of it! You’ll feel better if you’ve got that to
keep her from breaking,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Center shot, son; plumb center! Shore you got
almost human intelligence!” grinned Big John, lowering
the pole again. Sid seemed to have an even
better idea than that, now. He coiled the lariat and
cast it up, to fall around a rock pinnacle above them.
Then he tied its other end near the center of the
pole and they let it fall slowly, paying out rope
while Big John guided it by main strength until
its other end rested square in the jagged black pit
of the cave across the chasm from where they were
standing.</p>

<p>“Ain’t afraid of nawthin’, now, with that good
old rawhide lariat holdin’ her up,” declared Big John,
beginning to climb across. Sid followed him, once
the heavy bulk of the cowman had left the pole on
the other side. Below him dropped away an endless
shadowy chasm, with the tiny pines and firs of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
valley visible hot in the sunlight far below. On
both sides towered above him the huge smooth walls
of the chimney made by the pinnacle and its neighbors.
Sid cast a mere glance at the prospect below,
and then climbed over swiftly and joined Big John
in the black depths of the tunnel.</p>

<p>It was some time before their eyes became accustomed
to the dim light. Up and up inside the living
rock the narrow fissure climbed. Old steps, cut in
the rock or built of flat stone slabs, guided them.
Here and there light was let in by those irregular
ragged holes in the cliff wall which they had seen
from below.</p>

<p>“No one but a shaman would live here,” declared
Sid, speaking ethnologically; “a basket of corn, some
dried meat and a string of peppers would last him
a whole season. But there’s water up here somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Hed orter be!” said Big John laconically. “This
place’s as dry as the professor’s book, whar the dust
flewed out of the pages when you opened it. Besides,
that Indian’d grow a beard a mile long while
he’s jest gittin’ down out’n hyar fer a drink!”</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> water up there. After a long climb,
when their aching knees positively refused to lift for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
another step, they came to a little basin hollowed
out of the rock by human hands. A thin trace of
water came weeping down from somewhere in the
interior here, to lose itself and evaporate on the outside
cliff face. A spruce growing out of the crevice,
which they could see through the next window,
showed that all that water was being preëmpted by
just that one tree. A spruce seed had found it somehow.
Nature leaves nothing unutilized.</p>

<p>A blaze of light now lit up the chasm ahead. The
gallery in the rock became more open and led upward
to a wide door cut out of the rock. Here the
shaman of long ago had looked out on the frailties
and follies of the world below him, serene, indifferent,
meditating on the destinies of his people. Those
times surely needed one wise man to sit apart and
do the thinking for them all, for in this pueblo
country the hostile and warlike Apaches had been
fearsome invaders even before the time of the
Spaniards. How long before that they and the
Navaho had come down from the far north no man
knows. But they found the peaceful and sedentary
pueblo Indians an easy prey, and gradually they
drove them all out of these cliff dwellings in the
mountains to build themselves defensive villages on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the high mesas of the Painted Desert to the north.</p>

<p>Sid and Big John stopped at that natural doorway
to look out below. Cañon Honanki lay a
green-spired paradise below them. Bare, barren
cliffs, streaked with color, rose opposite. A short
way down the valley the horses could be picked out
grazing placidly. The watchful Blaze lay near them
and he rose and barked at sight of his master, his
faint volleys echoing up the cliffs.</p>

<p>“Now for Mr. Inaccessible—the cavate dwelling!”
exclaimed Sid triumphantly. He led on upward until
he came to a low door built in a stone wall laid
up without mortar. Entering it, they saw that a
round window cut through the cliff stone lit up the
small cave room. Baskets, finely woven, of a texture
and quality seldom seen nowadays, greeted Sid’s delighted
eyes. There were shallow marriage and
ceremonial baskets; bottle-shaped ones waterproofed
with piñon gum, the kind now called <i>tus</i> and used in
medicine dances; large granary baskets still filled
with dry kernels of blue, black, red, and white corn.
A few black pottery jars, decorated with white
lightning zigzags, stood in the corners. Strings of
corn ears, red peppers, and dried onions, all musty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and shriveled, hung from poles let into the roof of
the cave.</p>

<p>“The old bird was a rain-maker, all right,” said
Big John, pointing irreverently at the zigzags on the
jars and baskets. “Claimed he invented the lightning,
all-same as Benjamin Franklin.”</p>

<p>But Sid did not answer. Instead his eyes were
riveted in sheer astonishment on the smooth rock
wall of the cave, and he grabbed Big John’s sleeve
and pointed, speechless with wonder.</p>

<p>“Gorry!—Look there, John!” he finally found
breath to exclaim. “Here is the <i>last</i> place a fellow
would expect to see the writing of a white man,
I’ll say!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be durned!” growled Big John, peering
at the letters with Sid.</p>

<p>Written on the wall, in red earth letters and still
as bright as the day they were made, was—a name!
a Spanish name!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fra Pedro Del Vacas, 1680.</span></p>

<p>“Can you beat it!” cried Sid, breathlessly. “Gorry,
what a find!—Le’s see, John,” he went on excitedly,
“1680 was the year of the big massacre, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Search me!” said Big John whimsically. “All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
I know about them greasers is that you shore don’t
have to oil yore bullets none to slip ’em through their
feathers.”</p>

<p>“Sure it was 1680!” continued Sid, ignoring Big
John’s observation upon our Mexican neighbors.
“That year all the tribes rose against their Spanish
friars. Most of them were murdered or martyred—especially
those that the Apaches got hold of. This
Fra came up here to the old shaman for refuge.
<i>Why</i> did he write that inscription then? Because
he was dying, of course! Escaped from the Apaches
somehow, wounded perhaps, and was carried up
here by the pueblo people. The Spanish missionaries
did not carve their initials on every rock. He left
his name for the next missionary to find, if ever
one should visit this pueblo again. It means something,
John. We’ll look for pueblo graves, next,
and maybe get some more light on it.”</p>

<p>Sid’s idea of searching for graves might seem
astounding to any one but an ethnologist. But the
richest prehistoric relics are always obtained from
exhumed graves, usually located near some shaman’s
cave. The body was always mummied, and with it
were buried most of the pueblo Indian’s possessions.
Here the early cotton blankets, yucca sandals, baskets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
pottery, and weapons are found in a tolerable
state of preservation, and they all show that the prehistoric
pueblo dwellers lived very much as their
descendants do to-day.</p>

<p>Big John was used to Sid’s intense enthusiasms in
ethnological matters and was accustomed to following
him around—to see that he “didn’t break his fool
neck an’ so cheat that rope that’s waitin’ fer him”
as he always put it. He bent his tall frame in pursuit
as Sid dodged out of the house and darted for a
deep and dusty grotto that lay behind it. A huge
horizontal fissure, not over four feet high, had been
worn out here by the waters, undermining the cliffs
above for a considerable distance. A stratum of
mud, long since dried to dust, covered the floor of
the fissure. Closely dotted over it were slabs of
stone, under each of which one would find a small
stone kiva or dry well. The mummy would be discovered
sitting upright in it, swathed about with
cotton blanketing made long before the first wool
from the first sheep that gave it was stolen from the
Spaniards by the Navaho. Generally also the
mummy was covered with ceremonial basketry. But
Sid passed them all by, for the present. What he
was searching for now was a white man’s grave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
And, far back under the rock he found it, a long
mound with a rude cross set in the dust at its head.
A single flat stone lay across the center of the
mound.</p>

<p>Raising it, the persistent Indian burial customs
proved to have been still adhered to. A long black
robe, with a ghastly skull peeping from the cowl,
lay flat on the bottom of the niche, which was a sort
of stone coffin, its sides lined with stone slabs built
in shallow walls precisely like the Indian rivas. The
top was roofed over with stone, on which the earth
had been mounded up as the white priest had evidently
directed it should be. There was nothing
else in the grave. Nothing, that is, but a <i>flat slab
of pottery</i>, lying across the dead friar’s chest!</p>

<p>Its square shape at once attracted Sid as unusual
and not Indian. He picked it up with queer thrills
running all through him. A message from that
white man of long ago! For there was writing
graven on the clay, and the three letters “D. O. M.”
stood at the head of the plaque.</p>

<p>“A Dominican friar, he was, John,” said Sid,
reverently. He began to read aloud the sonorous
Latin written on the plaque, conjuring up his forgotten
Cæsar of high-school days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“What’s that stuff, huh?” inquired Big John.
“Sounds like spig talk, but ’tain’t. I’m a hundred
per cent American, Sid, I am, an’ I don’t like it,” he
growled, shaking his head sturdily.</p>

<p>“Can’t make it out myself,” confessed Sid, after
reading it a little farther. He found that he had
forgotten his Latin so much that merely to pronounce
the words was an effort. “Here’s a few that
I <i>do</i> know, though, John: ‘<i>Aurum et Argentum</i>,’
that’s gold and silver; ‘<i>Pinacate</i>,’ ‘<i>Sonoyta</i>,’ those are
places; ‘<i>Papagoii</i>’, the Papagoes; ‘<i>Mesa Rubra</i>’ that’s
Red Mesa——”</p>

<p>“Never heard tell of it,” declared Big John,
promptly. “Thar’s a red mesa up Zuñi way, but
there’s no gold or silver thar; an’ Pinacate is a long
thirsty ride down over the lava country into Mexico.
Ain’t no mesas in that country nohow. She’s
all red lava saw-teeth an’ spiny choyas—if you
asks me.”</p>

<p>“It’s an old Spanish <i>mine</i>—that’s what the
plaque’s all about!” shouted Sid, excitedly. “Some
of the Papagoes must have told this old fra about
a gold and silver mine, located in Red Mesa down
Pinacate way—say, Scotty will have to hear of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
John!” whooped Sid, carried away by the enthusiasm
of the moment.</p>

<p>Big John shook his head solemnly: “Son, folks
has died of thirst <i>in thousands</i>, chasing lost Spanish
mines in that country! Santa Fé’s full of old priest
reports like this-yer. The Indians shore did stuff
’em with gauzy tales! Thar’s mineral down thar,
I’ll ’low; but after ye find it, what ye got? Reminds
me of the recipe for cookin’ a fish-duck. Ye
take an’ soaks him in three kinds of soup; bile him
four days; stuff him with an apple an’ a onion; tie
a bunch of celery ’round his neck, wrap him in a
couple of slabs of bacon; stick in a hunk of garlic;
add salt, pepper, and a bottle of wine; bake him
three hours—an’ presto, the gosh-darn fish-duck is
gone! That’s how a feller feels when he finds a
mine in that country, Sid; ye cayn’t git the miner’l
out nohow!”</p>

<p>Sid’s laughter pealed out. “Well, we’ll hunt up
old Scotty just the same and then go get some one
to translate this Latin. Scotty’ll just go crazy over
this tablet, and he needs the money, John. We can
come back here for the Indian relics some other time.
Scotty and Niltci are prospecting down in the Santa
Catalinas for mineral, right now, you know——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“An’ they won’t find nawthin’ down thar thet
ain’t been found long ago, jest as I told him,” interjected
Big John.</p>

<p>“Sure! We’ll ride down there and give him this
tablet. It will be a life-saver for old Scotty! Red
Mesa or bust! John—how’s that for a new motto?”</p>

<p>“Looks handsome, but she ain’t edible,” said Big
John, enigmatically.</p>

<p>But Sid just couldn’t get over his enthusiasm for
his chum Scotty’s sake about this Latin tablet. What
a find for good old Les! That mine would be his
big chance! Friendship was sweet; to be able to do
something for a chum was keen pleasure. He sat
down and went on studying over the tablet, balking
at strange Latin words, digging up more of them
out of his memories of his school Cæsar. The old
pottery plaque fascinated him. He kept speculating
about it, how it came to be made, where the old fra
had got his information about the mine. What an
ancient old story this was!</p>

<p>“This fra used to live with the cavate dwellers
here, John, I tell you! He made this plaque and
had them fire it when they baked their own pottery.
Imperishable record, you see. It’s a real find, I tell
you! One of those lost Spanish mines that really <i>is</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
so! ‘<i>In regione Papagoii</i>’ that’s the Papago country
of Pinacate, all right. ‘<i>XXI milia S-O ab
Pinacate</i>’ plain as shootin’, twenty-one miles northeast
from Pinacate, ‘<i>Mesa Rubra</i>’—there’s a hill
that looks like a red mesa down there—that’s the
dope! Gee! What a start for good old Scotty!
Le’s go! We’ll ride straight for his camp in the
Catalinas!”</p>

<p>Big John grinned saturnine grins as he deposited
the pottery plaque in the small rucksack without
which he never left his horse. Then he got up and
followed the eager Sid down the long, dark ascent of
steps up which they had come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

THE LURE OF THE MINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“IT’S panning out mighty low-grade stuff!—Dog-gone
it!”</p>

<p>The young man who made this ejaculation,
and in a most discouraged tone, too, was slender
and wiry, with sandy reddish hair surmounting a
Scotch cast of features. His face was freckled and
sunburned. The inextinguishable hope of youth
still flickered in his blue eyes, but there was worry,
anxiety, there, too—the sign of that nagging, cankering
care that keeps a fellow thin.</p>

<p>He shook his head as he held up a test tube in its
wooden holder to the sunlight.</p>

<p>“Won’t do!” he muttered. “Anybody can find
<i>a</i> mine in Arizona—but few can find a paying one.”</p>

<p>He looked about him at the silent and colorful
mountains surrounding him, hopeless misery in his
eyes. They had no answer for him! The brush
sunshade that he and the Indian boy who was his
companion had established was Scotty Henderson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
base camp for mine prospecting. Our readers may
have met him before—on the trip for the Ring-necked
Grizzly in Montana or when after the Black
Panther of the Painted Desert country of Arizona.</p>

<p>Leslie Henderson—Scotty’s real name—had a
heavy load to carry, for a youth of nineteen. It
weighed nothing physically but mentally it was a
burden far beyond his years. And the letter from
his mother that he was now carrying in a hip pocket
of his riding breeches had added a sickening load
upon a mind already worn with anxiety. It had
told him, as gently and self-sacrificingly as possible,
of his mother’s decision to sell the old Henderson
place back east. The cost of living had gradually
come to exceed Major Henderson’s pension, which
was all the Great War had left them of his father,
the good old Doctor. To a woman used to comforts
and a roof over her head as a matter of course,
to say nothing of the ancestral associations of that
homestead, that decision of Scotty’s mother was
a far heavier blow to her than her words would
admit. Delicately put, it meant in plain words that
Scotty would either have to strike a paying mine
claim <i>soon</i> or else give up his heritage of independence,
that heritage that every real man claims as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
birthright, and take a position somewhere in some
great mining corporation. And the outlook was
pretty black, now.</p>

<p>“No go, Niltci!” groaned Scotty, emptying the
green fluid in the test tube with a gesture of discouragement,
“we’ll have to break camp and
move on.”</p>

<p>With that decision the hopelessness of all this
endless prospecting surged over Scotty in an overwhelming
wave. Arizona had been combed all over
for mines! There was plenty of this sort of thing,
this scanty and scattered deposit of copper carbonate,
poor in per cent of metal, all through its
mountains. The real thing was far different. Not
impossible to locate; for each year, even now, sees
some new and fabulous lode opened up. But the
scattered, thin deposit of this gulch would take a
mountain railroad to develop it and the most expensive
of electric process works to reduce it to
metal. Take this ore back east and men could make
money out of it, but that “take,” that train-haul
which would cost more than the ore was worth, was
the rub!</p>

<p>For a moment a gorgeous vista of temptation
opened up before Scotty. All he really needed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
do to become rich was to go east with some of these
picked specimens and float a “paper” copper mine,
the kind that robs thousands of poor people of their
earnings by false and visionary “literature”; that
were never intended to do more than line the pockets
of those scoundrels who make their living cheating
the public that way.</p>

<p>But the mute reproach of the silent mountains to
that temptation was enough for Scotty. Even the
poor prospector with burro and pick who had come
this way before had been too honest for that! He,
some one of him, had without doubt explored this
very valley long before Scotty; he had looked over
this ore and gone on, knowing well that in practice it
would never pay.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” said Scotty to himself, his honest
soul recoiling in horror before the gilded prospect
of a wildcat mine floated back east. “But, while
there’s life there’s dope!” he grinned. “Where
next? Dashed if I know! Le’s break camp anyhow,
Niltci.”</p>

<p>The Indian youth grunted inquiringly from where
he squatted, with the stoic patience of the Indian,
under their brush shade. He pointed a coppery finger
out at a lariat rope stretched between two mesquites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
in the sunlight of the hill slope. On it hung
a ragged collection of meat strips, like stockings on
a clothesline. They still glistened, raw and red, in
the hot blaze of the cloudless sky overhead.</p>

<p>“<i>Charqui</i> no done,” he demurred, shaking his
head. “Three sleeps yet.”</p>

<p>He was referring to their store of dried venison;
“jerky” as the cowmen call it, only he used the original
Spanish name for it, <i>charqui</i>—dried meat.</p>

<p>“Gee, I’d forgot about our grub stake! Hope,”
observed Scotty, “springs infernal in the human
breast, Niltci! Grub’s our real problem, now.
Let’s let the mine wait and play hunters a bit, eh?”</p>

<p>As if to answer him the musical notes of a hound
belled down from a distant mountain flank. There
was sparse, dry-soil timber all over these hills, piñon,
spruce, stunted western yellow pine and the inevitable
aspens. The hills were bare and bony, and
they blazed with orange and lavender color, for it
was November, but there was game in the valley
timber, lots of it, deer, cougar, bobcat, and an occasional
cinnamon bear. Wild turkey inhabited the
depths of the cañons, so plentiful that they formed
the daily fresh meat of their camp in addition to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the abundant trout which the Apaches disdained to
catch and eat.</p>

<p>Scotty listened a moment to the musical notes
floating down through the valley.</p>

<p>“There goes Ruler!” he cried. “Let’s get the
horses and see what he’s after!”</p>

<p>Niltci, the Navaho boy, sprang to his feet grunting
assent eagerly. His lithe form bounded down the
slope towards a grass meadow, his red bandanna
a blazing note of color, set off by an equally blazing
white cotton shirt contrasting with his long,
dark blue leggins which sparkled with rows of barbaric
silver buttons. In a trice he was leading back
Scotty’s chestnut mare and his own flea-bitten desert
pony. Ever since Niltci had miraculously “disappeared”
during the religious excitements of his own
people over the Black Panther, he had been with
Scotty on his mining expeditions down here, far to
the south in the Apache country of White River and
far away from his own people. To his white friends
he had owed his life that time—a debt that, to a
Navaho, is never paid.</p>

<p>He handed Scotty the mare’s halter and started
deftly saddling his own pony. Ruler’s bays came
unceasingly down through the mountains. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
giant coonhound was of an indomitable persistence;
he could be depended upon to follow that trail, whatever
it was, for days on end without relenting.</p>

<p>“Up the coulée, Niltci!” shouted Scotty, vaulting
his horse and clattering down the slope from camp.
Behind him the fast hoofbeats of the Navaho’s
pony followed. The mare crossed the creek bottom
in a single jump and began working up the opposite
flank in a long slant. On ahead an occasional yelp
from Ruler gave inkling of his whereabouts. He
was traveling fast, for the distance between them
did not seem to close up. Frightened deer burst
from cover and dashed down and across the stream
bottom as they rode. A wild turkey, scared into
flight by the showers of rolling stones struck loose
by the horses, soared over the willows in the ravine
and disappeared in a mass of thick green.</p>

<p>Then, behind Scotty, Niltci grunted eagerly and
made a queer sound that was half a yelp.</p>

<p>“Yep! I see him, Niltci—cougar! There he
goes!—regular old he-one!” gasped Scotty, jouncing
in his saddle as he bent to drag his rifle from
the holster. The mare shied as the heavy .405
swung out around her flanks. Scotty’s knees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
gripped her fast and he let the horse go with the
bridle reins dropped over the pommel.</p>

<p>Ruler’s deep tones now came back in explosive
volleys.</p>

<p>“<i>Ow-ow-ow! Ow-ow-ow!</i>” he sang, belling a hot
trail.</p>

<p>“Heading north, up the cañon!” yelled Scotty,
galloping through the timber at full speed. “<i>Look</i>
at him <i>go</i>!”</p>

<p>He pointed out a running cougar far up on the
yellow mountain sides, galloping along in easy
bounds that seemed effortless. His tawny body
doubled and stretched out in the queer lope of the
cat tribe, now trotting with fast-moving feet, now
humping up in the swinging bounds of the gallop.
He seemed very like a buff and white household cat
magnified to enormous size. His tail drooped behind,
tapering from a thick root seemingly as wide
as his hips to a ropy furry length that undulated
as he sprang easily up over the rock ledges.</p>

<p>“Gee, he’s an old Tom, Niltci!” called back Scotty
over his shoulder, “<i>Hi-Hi!</i>—Go it, Ruler!”</p>

<p>The big reddish brown coonhound yodeled in answer.
He was racing along perhaps halfway between
them and the cougar, a red dot on the hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
sunlight, bellowing forth bursts of hound music as
he ran. Above them soared the high walls of the
cañon, at least a mile up to the rim, yellow and blue-shadowed
and dotted with dark green conifers. A
hideous gulch, as it would look to a city dweller,
terminated the cañon walls as they narrowed, and
it was cleft high above by a dry arroyo that was all
stones and boulders. But to Scotty this was the
finest place on earth, and it was a jolly old world
anyhow—in spite of mines that failed to pan out!
His one anxiety was that the cougar might reach
the timber up on the rim plateau and then turn on
Ruler before they could get up there. The cat
was far up, near the head of the gulch, and going
even faster than they were. Like tiny Japanese
pines the distant trees on the rim seemed to welcome
him, and, while the panting horses and men labored
hard up the slope, the cougar bounded over a ledge
of broken rock and was gone into the timber.</p>

<p>Niltci grunted. “<i>Wah!</i>” he exclaimed disgustedly.
“Lose dog! Cougar kill him! No good! Take
pony quick—me climb up straight.”</p>

<p>His little horse clattered close behind and Scotty
reached back for the bridle. Niltci vaulted from
the saddle and with quick lithe movements he began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
to climb vertically up the cañon slope. Scotty
urged the mare on up the long slant that would
bring him out somewhere near the beginning of the
cleft that made the arroyo. He got two glimpses
of Niltci’s blue leggins swarming up over vertical
ledges far above him; one brief sight of Ruler
scrambling up over the rim ahead on the cougar’s
trail; and then he was all alone, with the empty,
silent, gorgeous mountains brooding majestically
around him. With his passing and the shower of
stones that his pony was sending down, they would
return again to the eternal peace that was theirs.
Apache, frontiersman, cavalryman, prospector, all in
their turn had come and gone, to disturb their meditations
for a brief moment, to pass on leaving these
lonely cliffs and pines their silent and inscrutable
witnesses.</p>

<p>Scotty leaned over and whispered a word in the
mare’s ear. The noble creature was giving him her
best, with the boundless generosity and disinterestedness
of our four-footed hunting companions,
but somehow, somewhere, she found it in her to call
upon an extra burst of speed, some hidden reserve
in response to her master’s whisper. The top of the
gulch was near now. With distended nostrils, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
heaving flanks, and hoarse soughing breath the mare
toiled up the last ledges and then vaulted over the
rim.</p>

<p>An open country of great pines was that plateau.
Shadows and sunlight flecked the needles under the
huge <i>ponderosas</i>. Scotty saw a white flash running
like a deer through the tree trunks—Niltci, who
could run faster than a horse for a short spurt. He
was far ahead, and as for Ruler, only a deep ringing
bay told of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>“<i>Wahoo!—Wahoo!</i>” sang out Scotty, his whoops
intended more to let them know he was up and coming
than anything else. The pony he led behind
him snorted and whickered at sight of Niltci and
Scotty let him go free at the hint. The flea-bitten
little mustang immediately loped on ahead in a fast
clatter. This urged the mare to top speed again,
for she would let no horse pass her, if wind and
legs could prevent it!</p>

<p>Came a wild piercing screech and a savage miauling
on ahead somewhere. It sounded hoarse and
ropy and vengeful; terrifying; intended to strike
a paralysis of fright into the creature attacked.
Scotty realized that the cougar had turned to the
attack, finding that only a dog was following him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Then Ruler’s voice floated back, yelping and barking
in a mixed medley of pain and fury. Scotty
knew instantly what had happened. The old Tom
was mauling the dog unmercifully. He would kill
Ruler if help did not come instantly. Ruler was
all of eighty pounds in weight but the cougar was
at least two hundred and fifty and could beat him
easily in a single combat.</p>

<p>A piercing whoop came from Niltci in answer to
Ruler’s cry of distress. Scotty at once whipped out
the heavy .405 and its thunderous roar rang out.
The mare ducked and shied under its cannonlike reports,
but Scotty fired again and again, for he hoped
the sound of the bullets ripping through the timber
would frighten the cat into treeing if not too savagely
engaged with Ruler.</p>

<p>As the mare burst out into an open glade, a wild
drama under the pines across from it met Scotty’s
eyes. Ruler was dodging and giving back, the cat
following up and striking again and again with a
tawny and scimitar-clawed forepaw—bright flashes
in the sunlight as of curved steel hooks. Niltci was
racing across the clearing, his bright knife flashing
in the sun, his wild black hair streaming out behind
him. He was sprinting his utmost to save the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
hound but he would be too late if one of those terrible
blows ever got home on Ruler!</p>

<p>Scotty threw the mare back on her haunches and
raised a wabbling rifle barrel. The scene through
the sights was not reassuring. Dog and cougar
were so instantly changing places that it was impossible
to fire. All this was happening with the
quickness of thought, and Scotty felt reluctant to
fire even a flash shot, for Ruler was whirling about
so fast that he might run into the bullet while it
was getting there.</p>

<p>And then a queer thing happened. <i>Another</i>
tawny and grizzled body suddenly projected itself
into the fray! Where <i>he</i> came from Scotty could
not imagine, but a volleying bay of savage barks told
him that it was no cougar but another dog.</p>

<p>Scotty stared for a moment, rifle lowered. Then—“<i>Blaze!</i>”
he yelled in amazed delight—“<i>Yeeoow!</i>—Tear
him, puppy!” he whooped. The giant Airedale
launched himself like a gray thunderbolt surcharged
with vim and power at the cougar’s throat.
As Scotty watched them, not daring to fire, the cat
spun around and Ruler instantly seized a hock hold.
Claws flew through the air. Blaze bounded about
the cat like a rubber ball, just out of reach. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
whoop of triumph came from Niltci as he closed in
swiftly with upraised knife. For a tense instant
Scotty sat watching a chance to fire from his saddle,
his heart beating so that he could hear the pulses
through his own open mouth. Then the cat whirled
and soared through the air in one tremendous bound
that carried him twenty feet away. He hit the
ground running. There is no such speed as an old
Tom can put on when in a tight place! He seemed
literally to fly through the air, Blaze and Ruler a
jump or two behind him. Niltci gave up the chase
and snatched at the bridle of his pony as that faithful
creature raced up after him. Scotty put spurs
to the mare and galloped off in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>“<i>Hi!</i> Blaze! <i>Hi!</i> Ruler!—<i>Wahoo!</i>” he yelled,
throwing the bridle over the mare’s neck. In answer
a stentorian <i>Whoopee!</i> came ringing back
through the forest. That was a <i>man’s</i> voice, and
almost immediately following it there was a crash
in the timber and a white horse thundered through
the pines at right angles to Scotty’s course, the tree
trunks seeming to pass the white flash of the horse
like fence pickets.</p>

<p>“<i>Left!—Left!—You pisen—li’l—horned—toad!</i>”
came Big John’s iron voice, jolting to the rhythm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of his gallop. Scotty whooped back greeting at him
and then wheeled obediently. The cat and both
dogs were in plain sight ahead of him but Big John
had an uncanny foresight in the ways of big game,
and he had no doubt foreseen some sort of twist or
short cut on the cougar’s part. The timber cleared
ahead of Scotty now, and out to the left in it he saw
a giant pine, already dying of old age. For it the
cougar had turned and was now racing at top speed.
He ran up its huge bole like a cat climbing a tree,
a shower of bark spalls raining down from his claws.
At the first big dead branch he stopped and turned
below his black muzzle, spitting and snarling from
an open pink mouth at the dogs underneath. Ruler
was prancing around on his hind legs, yelling with
eagerness, while Blaze savagely scrambled up the
trunk, to lose his grip and tumble down and indomitably
attempted it again.</p>

<p>Big John reined in the white horse. “Now’s yore
chance to do the pretty, Scotty, old-timer—afore he
jumps down—<i>shoot!</i>” he yelled.</p>

<p>Scotty quieted the mare and raised the .405. Its
enormous bellow rang out. The cat screeched and
launched forth with all four claws spread in the
convulsive flurry of death. He struck the pine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
needles with a heavy thud and instantly the dogs
charged in, growling and worrying at him, while old
Tom rolled over on his back and spun his claws in
the instinctive defense of a cat in his last throes.
Niltci clattered up on the mustang at that instant.
In a flash he had leaped from his horse, bounded to
the cougar’s side and jumped away, leaving a red
knife-handle sticking out behind the cougar’s shoulder
blades. Again there was a flash of his nimble
body and the knife came out, while blood spurted
six feet from the gash. The cougar groaned and
stretched out on his side, quivering and sighing
peacefully as if falling asleep. His eyes glazed; then
the body stiffened and stretched in a last tremor.</p>

<p>Blaze ran up on the carcass and bared white fangs
at Ruler. His attitude was crinky, cocky as a prize
fighter’s, and he honestly believed that he had killed
that whole cougar all by himself! He dared Ruler
to come on. As the latter had convictions of his
own concerning that cat, a royal dog-fight seemed
imminent—but Niltci seized the hound’s collar and
held him back by main force.</p>

<p>Big John laughed uproariously. “Hol’ him,
Injun!” he roared. “Ruler’ll be gobblin’ more’n he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
kin chow, fust ye know! That Blazie boy’s feelin’
reel mean an’ ornery, danged ef he ain’t!”</p>

<p>Scotty laughed as Big John dismounted to boot
the Airedale off the cougar, for Niltci had signified
that he wanted to begin skinning out but wasn’t any
too anxious to go near the belligerent Blaze.</p>

<p>“Where’s Sid, John?” asked Scotty, collecting his
thoughts for the first coherent greeting that the swift
action of the hunt so far had allowed.</p>

<p>The big cowman’s eyes twinkled. “Sid, he ain’t
travelin’ none, these days,” he grinned. “He’s back
thar, somewhar, nursin’ along a sort of present for
ye, Scotty.” He winked enigmatically at the youth.</p>

<p>“How come?” asked Scotty, mystified. “Present,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Yaas, he’ll come a-singin’ with it, pronto. Some
dago writin’ on a piece of Injun pottery, ’tis. We-all
was headin’ for yore camp when we heard Ruler
kyoodlin’ back thar a-piece,” he explained, “so
Blazie and I, we ’lows to set in the game. But Sid
he’s afear’d to ride, which-same’s because he mought
break that thar curio. We found it in one of them
caves, after the most all-fired climb this hombre ever
got inter, I’m settin’ here to tell ye——”</p>

<p>“Here he comes, now!” interrupted Scotty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
whipping off his sombrero to wave it at a new rider
who came plodding through the pines with a led
pack cayuse following him. “<i>Whoopee!</i>—Oh, Sid!”
he yelled.</p>

<p>The rider waved back. The dogs put out for him
pell-mell, Ruler leaping and fawning up on his saddle
flanks, so overjoyed was he at seeing Sid again,
the Airedale jealously shoving in to get his share
of the caresses. Presently Sid rode up to where
Big John and Niltci were busily skinning out the
cougar and butchering big sections of the delicious
meat.</p>

<p>“Hi, Sid!—what’s all this Big John’s telling me
about a present?” Scotty greeted him. “Gosh
knows, I was feeling pretty blue not so very long
ago! Did you remember it was my birthday or anything?”
he bantered.</p>

<p>“It’s a <i>mine</i> for you, Scotty!” announced Sid,
breathlessly, his eyes alight with the joy of him who
gives, “an old Spanish mine! Got the dope here
on a pottery tablet that we found in a cave dwelling.”</p>

<p>“Gorry!—a mine!—le’s see it!” cried Scotty. “A
real, sure-enough mine? I’d begun to think there
was no such thing left in Arizona.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“It’s at a place called Red Mesa, down near Pinacate,
Scotty,” said Sid. “The dope’s all in Latin
and I can’t read much of it, but we’ll hunt up a priest
somewhere and get him to translate it——”</p>

<p>Scotty’s face fell, even while Sid was speaking.
“‘Down near Pinacate!’” he echoed, huge disappointment
in his tones. “It <i>can’t</i> be, Sid! Why,
that’s all lava country! There’s no mesa or mineral
down there.”</p>

<p>“How about the Ajo Mines?” challenged Sid.
“And there’s lots of ore north of Sonoyta, only it
costs too much to work it. You know that yourself.”</p>

<p>“By gosh, you never can tell!” exclaimed Scotty,
excitedly. “It’s possible, though! There’s granite
outcropping, even down at MacDougal Pass, only
fifteen miles from Pinacate. We’ll try it!”</p>

<p>“Hope it isn’t in Mexican territory—but no,
‘twenty-one miles northeast of Pinacate,’ the
plaque says——”</p>

<p>“Gee! Le’s see it!” cried Scotty eagerly.</p>

<p>Big John grinned sardonic grins as the two youths
got the plaque out of Sid’s saddlebags and held it
between them, scanning it excitedly. He heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Scotty eagerly bark out the word “‘<i>aurum</i>’—gold?”
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“’Pears to me that every white man but me goes
crazy over that word ‘gold’!” he growled whimsically.
“Fellers will lie, steal, murder, get themselves killed
with thirst or et by grizzlies—an’ all for somethin’
that they don’t want when they’ve got it!” he exclaimed.
“Scotty, ef it warn’t for you bein’ a minin’
engineer I’d warn ye to leave it <i>alone</i>!” he said positively.
“Exceptin’ it’s now November and the tanks
is probably full down thar, I wouldn’t let you go,
nohow.”</p>

<p>But Scotty was hardly listening to him. A planning
look was in his eye and his engineer mind was
already envisioning not the mine itself but the practical
ways to get out the metal.</p>

<p>“Ship base in Adair Bay; burros up to the mine;
carry the ore in bottoms through the Panama Canal
to the East, where we can get cheap process reduction—Gee!
There’s nothing to it!” he averred enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“C’rect—nawthin’ a-tall, li’l hombre!” grinned
Big John sardonically. “No water; no feed for
yore burros; no road—an’ no <i>mine</i>!” he declared.</p>

<p>“Yes, but ships, John!” urged Scotty. “That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
different. We can send out a year’s supply of hay,
oats and supplies for the camp just as they do at
Las Pintas, and bring back the bottoms in ore. It’s
mighty different from some inland proposition, hundreds
of miles from either rail or sea routes. If
this tablet is reliable, the engineering side of it is a
cinch! Le’s hear the ethnologist.”</p>

<p>Sid spoke up on this prompting: “We know well
that all that country has been explored since the
earliest times by the Spaniards,” he contributed.
“Sonoyta has been inhabited by them for over two
hundred years, and one of their oldest missions is
San Xavier, the one for Papago Indians who used
to hunt all that country. The friars were Dominicans—D.O.M.,
you see. This Fra Pedro undoubtedly
got his information from some Papago visitors
to the pueblo tribes. He made that pottery record
and had it fired while proselyting among the pueblos
of the San Pedro River—probably named the river
himself after his patron saint. It all fits in, see,
John? Then he got wounded or hurt, somehow,
in the general massacre of the friars in 1680 and
died in the refuge of that cavate dwelling. The
Indians buried his plaque with him in a sort of kiva.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
The thing seems straight enough to me,” concluded
Sid.</p>

<p>“Me too!” grinned Big John. “I gotto nurse you
two pisen mean young reptyles down into that no-man’s
land—I see <i>that</i>!” he snorted. “Waal, le’s
git back to yore camp, Scotty, an’ I’ll git the outfit
ready. Niltci’s goin’, of course. We gotto hev at
least <i>one</i> Injun down in that country. Thar’s lots
of mountain sheep down thar, an’ that means hoss
feed, galleta grass. We’ll git a few pronghorns
(antelope), mebbe, out’n them lava craters. Ef the
tanks is not dry, we kin resk it.”</p>

VASQUEZ</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LEAVING Big John and Niltci hard at work
making pemmican from the cougar and
deer meat, and bags of pinole or parched
corn meal from corn purchased at a near-by Apache
encampment, Sid and Scotty rode a day’s march
through the mountains to where there was a mission
school—San Mateo of the Apaches. Scotty’s
idea was to get the Red Mesa tablet translated by
the teacher, who no doubt still remembered his
Latin.</p>

<p>A small adobe schoolhouse of primitive Spanish
architecture came in sight shortly after noon, surmounting
a little knoll in the mountains. As they
rode toward it Indian children, boys and girls, came
running and yelling around them to beg pennies,
and with them as an escort they rode up to the
hitching rail before the school, dismounted and entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>A lone Mexican teacher, poor and of uncertain
temper apparently, sat reading at the school desk as
they entered. With an annoyed exclamation in
Spanish he put down his book and came toward
them during the time that their eyes were becoming
accustomed to the dim light of the interior of the
building.</p>

<p>“And what can I do for the señores?” inquired the
man suspiciously, after the usual polite Spanish
greetings had been exchanged.</p>

<p>Sid had already sized him up with a sense of misgiving,
even then, before a word of their object had
been disclosed. The Mexican—his nationality
oozed out all over him—was a little weazened man,
dirty, old, with one eye drooping nearly shut from
some violent slash gotten during his past history.
His face bore a sardonic, cynical, rascally expression,
even under the smooth suavity of the crooked
smile that now leered upon them. Sid felt like taking
Scotty’s arm and leading him away, right then
and there! Surely this man was no one to trust
with such a mining secret as might be written on
the Red Mesa tablet.</p>

<p>But Scotty had already guilelessly begun explaining
their visit. His simple, “We have a Latin inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
here, señor, that we would like you to translate
for us,” had settled it, for the man was already
holding out his hand for the plaque which Scotty
bore.</p>

<p>“You understand Latin, señor?” put in Sid, hoping
that he didn’t.</p>

<p>“Vasquez,” supplied the Mexican, “ees my name.
For the Latin, <i>si!</i>—indifferently,” he shrugged.
“Anything that my poor efforts can do to help you,
though—” Once more he held out his hand for
the plaque.</p>

<p>Again Sid felt that queer inner warning not to
let the matter go further. He disliked any man
who depreciated his own worth with every other
word. Due modesty was admirable, but this groveling
disdain of one’s self was in truth but the inevitable
expression of a fundamental lack of esteem
for one’s own integrity—and that usually came from
a guilty conscience.</p>

<p>But it was too late now. Before Sid could obey
a mad impulse to snatch the tablet away—no matter
what explanations might be needed—no matter how
absurd and incomprehensible and rude it might seem—the
Mexican had begun reading the script on the
pottery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“D.O.M.—Deo Optimo Maximo,” he rolled out
in the sonorous Latin tongue. That was as far as
he got in reading it out aloud to the boys. For,
immediately thereafter, an expression of amazed,
puzzled surprise came into his eyes as the boys
watched him reading over the script to himself.
Then Sid noted intense concentration, and this gradually
gave way to an expression of crafty cupidity,
an air of envisioning something other than the words
that his eyes were falling on, of planning big enterprise,
great affairs in connection with this tablet.
Vasquez went on to read the script entirely through
in a still, tense silence. Before he had finished, those
snaky black eyes of his were fairly blazing with
avarice. Talk of the power of the word “gold” to
excite man! This man’s primitive nature stood
stripped before the boys; revealed was an elemental
desire for possession before which the rights of
others, the entire veneer of civilization were stricken
off as phantoms. He might as well have been some
Mexican greaser griping at a pile of gold on some
disreputable faro table along the border!</p>

<p>As Sid watched, the face before him looked up.
Instantly it went blank, expressionless. There was
a period of reflection, while the boys waited expectantly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
then a crafty, planning look came into the
eyes.</p>

<p>He folded the plaque under his arm—gesture of
possession, which we are told, is nine points of the
law.</p>

<p>Vasquez smiled—a practical declaration of ownership—a
maddening, infuriating smile; the superior
smile of the older man toward youth, which seems
to question the right of the young man to busy himself
with anything at all but the toys of childhood.
Sid found it particularly unbearable. He had been
smiled at that way before, when some staid and
sophisticated professor had smiled indulgently at him
over some of his own theories in Indian ethnology,
theories which Sid propounded with all the fire of
his youthful enthusiasm and conviction.</p>

<p>“Caballeros,” said the Mexican craftily, “this
matter can have no possible interest to you, since
it happens to refer to the work of the missionary
brothers among the—ah, the Papagoes—” he hesitated,
referring to the script as if to refresh his
memory, his thought evidently being that the boys
might have recognized that word in the Latin.
“Over two hundred years ago this—ah, yes, missionary
matter it is, my young friends—was written concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
our poor red brothers who lived down near
Pinacate,” Vasquez smiled down at them suavely.</p>

<p>Sid glanced at Scotty. The latter’s Scotch nature
was so incensed over this bald smiling perversion of
what even his limited knowledge of Latin had told
him was the truth that he was utterly speechless.
“<i>Minem Argenti</i>” indeed! That meant “silver mine”
at any rate! Scotty’s faced blazed red, his eyes
burned blue fire. As for Sid, he saw no use in prolonging
this conversation further, for in craft the
Mexican was more than his match. Boylike he preferred
direct action.</p>

<p>“Sorry that I can’t see it that way, señor,” he
replied shortly, gulping down his indignation. “I
should be glad to furnish you with a copy of this
tablet for your archives, if you wish,” he conceded,
“but that original plaque is mine.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand for it with a gesture that
told he was not to be trifled with further. Vasquez
looked around desperately. Give him a moment more
and he would think up some smooth reply that would
at least gain time, perhaps argue the thing out of
their very hands! But Sid made a determined lunge
for him as the Mexican backed away.</p>

<p>At once the man raised his voice in a hoarse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
scream, “<i>Ladrones! Gringoes!</i>” he yelled, fending
off Sid with a push of his hand while he turned the
side with the plaque under his arm away from them.
Then he ran for a door at the back of the school.
Shrill yells and the shouts of Apache came in answer
to his call from outside. There was not a second
further to lose! Scotty sprang for the man, lunging
low in the football tackle for his legs, while Sid
with a fierce and accurate grip of his strong hands
tore the plaque away from under his arm, the scuffle
sending the three rolling together in a heap on
the dirt floor of the church.</p>

<p>“Quick! Make for that rear door!” barked Sid
as he and Scotty leaped to their feet. Vasquez
squirmed on the dirt floor of the schoolhouse, cursing
horribly in Spanish and rocking to and fro as
he hugged a sprained ankle. If looks could kill, the
malignant fire that darted from his snaky eyes
would have paralyzed them both! Sid raced for the
rear door while Scotty stood guard over the man
with threatening fists. The patter of running feet
sounded outside the ’dobe walls. Then a leggined
Apache, with long, matted black hair, stood blinking
in at them in the blazing square of sunlight that was
the front door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Sid had reached the back door. He looked in, then
beckoned Scotty to join him. The boy raced over
and, once inside the room, both boys slammed the
stout panels behind them and let drop a heavy oak
beam.</p>

<p>“There’s a small window, with a mesquite bush
growing out in front of it, Scotty—give me a stirrup
hold!” gasped Sid, who was breathing heavily from
their tussle.</p>

<p>He stepped up in Scotty’s clasped hands and
peered out the window, with one arm crooked over
the edge. A mesquite grew just outside, and it was
so heavily laden with dense clumps of mistletoe as
to be in a dying state. Sid figured they might climb
out into it and remain there undiscovered among
the mistletoe clumps for a few moments. Outside
he saw three or four Apache bucks running toward
the schoolhouse from the grass huts perched upon
the hillside. All over the village he heard an indescribable
commotion of children and squealing
squaws, but the Indians had no idea of what really
was the matter. So far only Vasquez’s screech for
help had come to their ears.</p>

<p>Sid climbed out through the window and then
reached down his arms to help Scotty up to its sill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
An uproar and a drumming of fists and impotent
squalls in Spanish was sounding outside the oak
door of the room as they both climbed out and
gained the shelter of the mesquite. As the last buck
outside ran into the school, Sid dropped to the
ground and the boys raced for their horses. An
outcry of Indian children greeted the appearance of
the two fugitives, but none offered to interfere; only
one little shaver had the presence of mind to run
shrieking to the school door while Sid and Scotty
were swinging up into their saddles.</p>

<p>“Now ride, Scotty, old scout—these Apache can
<i>run</i>!” grunted Sid, hanging low over his pinto and
putting spurs to him. Scotty’s mare had no idea of
letting that pinto leave her, so they galloped away
from San Mateo together, leaving behind a cloud of
dust and a riot of angry war whoops from the red
men piling out of the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>Sid’s caution as to the running abilities of the
Apache was entirely true. Behind them streaked
out two lean and sinewy bucks, who had raced out
of the school door and were coming after them like
arrows. What was more surprising was the way
they kept up that speed. The mare and the pinto
were going like the wind, but not a yard did those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Indians on foot behind them seem to lose! There
was not a horse save their own in sight. But three
men and a swarm of children were already running
down the hill to where the ragged poles of a horse
corral and the glint of a watering pond near by
shimmered in the broiling sun. Even barebacked
it would be some time yet before these could join in
the chase, but when it was once begun it would be
tireless.</p>

<p>Not a word passed between the boys. Both were
watching sharp ahead for prairie dog holes and
urging on their ponies at top gallop. If they could
outrun those two bucks behind them for half a
mile they would have passed the limits of even
Apache endurance. Indeed, before half the distance
between them and the friendly hills had
passed, they saw first one, then the other, give up,
with arms tossed up in weary abandon, as both
bucks threw themselves panting on the bare plain.
Sid and Scotty then let their ponies ride on at their
own stride. It was well to have an extra spurt left
in them to call on, even yet!</p>

<p>“Mucho bad, Sid; look back!” said Scotty, a short
time after the menace of the foot-racers had disappeared
and the two bucks had risen and begun slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
to retrace their steps back to the school. Sid turned
half around in his saddle. Out from the high ’dobe
façade of San Mateo were riding four horsemen
and their leader was swathed in a gaudy striped
Mexican serapé. Surely he was that rascally Vasquez.
And he would follow them until doomsday
for the Red Mesa tablet!</p>

<p>“The whole thing’s bad, Scotty,” replied Sid.
“This fellow knows now what’s written on the
tablet. Nothing can take that knowledge away from
him, either. We’ve got the plaque; but <i>he</i> has the
knowledge it contains—and I’ll bet it’s indelible in
his mind! They’ll never catch us with those Indian
ponies, but what’s to prevent his reporting this Red
Mesa mine to friends of his down in Mexico? What
then?—you can have my shirt if a squad of their
guerrillas doesn’t cross the border, pronto, and get
to Red Mesa first! See it? That’s where we get
off. I doubt if this fellow will follow us very hard.
He knows all he needs to know right now.”</p>

<p>Scotty rode on in silence. Indeed this business
<i>had</i> been bungled! Far better would it have been
for them to have ridden into Tucson and gotten some
scientist whom Sid knew and could trust to read the
Latin for them. The very word “Gold” is bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
medicine to let get abroad among the sons of men!
Many a miner’s stampede has been started on less.</p>

<p>As the trail reached the foothills they drew rein
and looked back. Far across the plain that little
knot of horsemen was still coming on in the tireless
lope of the Indian pony. Give them twenty miles of
it and their own horses would be run off their feet!</p>

<p>“Here’s where we’ve got to step light and easy,
old-timer!” grinned Sid. “The Indians will be in
their own country in these hills, and they know every
short cut to head us off. I wish Big John and
Niltci were here.”</p>

<p>Scotty growled assent abstractedly as they rode
up a bare and rocky arroyo. He was thinking of all
that this Red Mesa mine meant to him. If it really
existed, its nearness to the sea made the engineering
problems of it so simple that it would be easy to get
capital invested in it. Las Pintas mines, only thirty
miles south of Pinacate, had already established a
successful precedent for that, for it now had a little
railroad of its own and a ship base, just as the young
engineer had dreamed for Red Mesa. But now that
Red Mesa’s location was known to outsiders—and
after being buried two hundred years, too!—the
whole thing was a mess, and of his own naïve making.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
The curse of trustful youth! There was just
one point of hope. According to government regulations,
whoever got there first and staked out a
claim owned Red Mesa, now matter how discovered.</p>

<p>Scotty raged inwardly over it, driving his mare
hard under that maddening goad of chagrin. Sid,
who was less interested, followed phlegmatically behind.
As the trail reached up high on the flanks of
the mountains and headed up over a “saddle” into
the next valley, Scotty rode ahead, dismounted and
began climbing rapidly up toward the saw-teeth
ridges that hung low in the sky above him. A
persistent suspicion had haunted him ever since this
ride had begun, and now he wanted that suspicion
verified or dispelled.</p>

<p>As Sid passed below him then halted his pinto
and waited, Scotty climbed on up and soon was
peering through a ragged granite gap in the ridge.
Below him fell away the bare, sage-strewn slopes
and the low ridges of the foothills. Beyond that the
great sun-baked plain of San Mateo lay like a floor.
Up on its lonely hill, dim, in the blue distance, rose
the school, yellow, and as Spanish as old Mexico.
A mass of green around it told of water and of its
permanent Apache colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Scotty then searched the plain for signs of their
pursuers. At first he thought they had followed
them into the mountains, for the plain below was
bare as a table. Then he drew back, with a shock
of intense discouragement and misgiving, for his
eyes had at last found them—riding along under the
foothills, toward the <i>south!</i> There were two of the
Indians following Vasquez who was quirting his
pony mercilessly. The third Apache had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Gee!” groaned the boy anxiously. “He’s riding
south! Toward the railroad! That means a telegram
as soon as he can send one. And the third
Indian is following <i>us</i>!”</p>

<p>He scrambled down and told Sid his news.</p>

<p>“Kick me for a rank tenderfoot, Sid!” he groaned.
“Kick me from here back to camp, and then kick
me clear on down to Pinacate! Gorry, but I let the
cat out that time!”</p>

<p>Sid grinned. “Buck up, old settler!” he cheered
him. “I knew we were in wrong as soon as I saw
that greaser schoolmaster. To give the Red Mesa
plaque to some benign old priest to read, yes; but
this bird was just a sinful man like the rest of us.
The temptation proved too strong for him. Gee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
but you handed him our dope, as innocent as innocent!
Whee! Big John’ll think up something to
do about it, though, and if he don’t we will. Remember,
too, that Mexico is the land of <i>mañana</i>.
I doubt if they even get any one started up from
Sonora before we can make a fast push and get
there first, old scout, so don’t worry. Besides, they
can’t cross the border, unless a party of guerrillas
does it. And—they’d have a lot of explaining to do
to get the grant of a claim from the government
unless regularly entered as immigrants through
Nogales—which is further from Red Mesa than we
are. Our job, now, is to keep an eye on this third
Indian. He was sent after us as a spy, to keep track
of us and report, you can depend on that. We’ll
send Niltci after <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>Scotty rode on, more hopeful. Sid’s rugged
cheerfulness was what he always needed to brace
him up. The one strong note in his character was
his indomitable Scotch persistence. He never let
go a thing once his mind was set on it, but he was
easily disheartened and set back, for he had yet
to learn that nine-tenths of our troubles exist solely
in our imaginations.</p>

<p>It was nightfall when they reached camp. Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a sign had they seen of the third Indian, lurking
in the hills somewhere behind them. That he had
seen <i>them</i> was quite to be believed; he was probably
watching their entry into camp at that very
moment!</p>

<p>Big John hee-hawed when the boys told their
story; then he jumped up, cackling hideously,
grabbed Scotty and booted him all around the
camp. “Thar!—Ye pisen li’l, ornery, horned toad!—Gol-darn
ye—anyhow!” he guffawed, administering
that kicking that Scotty had begged for but Sid
had overlooked. “You boys ain’t satisfied with
draggin’ me down to a country glowerin’ with petrified
lava, but ye got to add to my troubles by ringin’
in a bunch of greasers on me! I tell ye what, Scotty,
Pinacate means, ‘Bug-that-stands-on-his-haid,’ in
Papago talk, an’ durned ef I don’t stand ye on <i>yore</i>
haid, ef we don’t find no mine—an’ we won’t! Up
you goes by the heels, I’ll be plumb hornswoggled
ef I don’t do it!”</p>

<p>“Yeeow—attaboy!” yelled Sid, enthusiastically.
“Well, how come? We’ve got to shake off this
Apache, first, or he’ll follow us clear down to Pinacate.
What’s the word, John?”</p>

<p>“My idee’s to do a leetle night ridin’, son—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
sorter leave Niltci behind,” grinned Big John enigmatically.
“Might’s well be rollin’ yore blankets
right now, boys. The jerky’s all done and Niltci’s
got it pickled away in a bunch of parfléche skins.”</p>

<p>That night the four horses, with Ruler and Blaze
on rawhide leaders, pulled out of camp in the silence
and gloom after dusk. One horse, Niltci’s flea-bitten
mustang, was led riderless, his halter tied to the tail
of Sid’s pinto. The white mustang that bore Big
John’s long frame started ahead up the trail, a
guide barely distinguishable in the faint light of the
big Arizona stars. Black and inky buttes, jagged
peaks and swelling ridges passed them in a slow
procession around the horizon while Big John led
on, stopping occasionally on the trail to reassure
himself by some blazed stake set up in a cairn of
stones or a rude corner of weathered granite rocks
marking a turning point in the route.</p>

<p>The sun rose over the range of mountains left
behind them next morning as the pack train wound
down through the last pass in the hills and crossed
the railroad track above Tucson. The horses were
watered at a little river near the tracks, a river that
was bravely hurrying on to its fate, to disappear
forever in the thirsty sands of the desert to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
north. Bare and rocky hills confronted them across
the valley. As they headed into them Sid turned
and looked back. A lone rider came galloping after
them like a black speck hurrying out of the ranges
across the valley. The whole party halted waiting
for the rider, whether friend or foe.</p>

<p>It was Niltci, the Navaho, flinging along Indian
fashion on a pony, his elbows flopping jerkily,
his whole body swaying with the loose abandon of
a rag tied somehow to the saddle.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Sid, as the Navaho boy overtook
them, “what’s become of Vasquez’s Apache scout?”</p>

<p>Niltci’s bronze face cracked once in a saturnine
grin. “<i>Quien sabe?</i>” (Who knows!) he shrugged
his dusty shoulders. “Me got hees pony!” That
was all they ever had out of him about it.</p>

<p>“Them thar rails says we gotta lope along pronto,
boys!” said Big John as he pushed the white mustang
to the head of the column. “Yore schoolmarm
friend has gone by hyar, in the cyars, shore’s yore
a foot high. ’Cause why? I didn’t see no pony
tracks headin’ down fer Tucson, nohow, comin’ down
this valley.”</p>

<p>“Think he’s gone to Nogales, by train, John?”
asked Scotty anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Shore has! Or else he’s takin’ the jerkwater
local out of Tucson to San Xavier, so he can reach
the Papago Reservation ahead of us. We’ll be
crossin’ thet Injun ole folks’ home soon as we git
out’n these hills an’ we’ll shore hev trouble!”</p>

<p>Big John shook his head ominously and urged on
the white mustang. For him the race for Red Mesa
had already begun.</p>

<p>“Yes, but the Papagoes are harmless,” objected
Scotty.</p>

<p>“Not this time of year!” put in Sid. “This is
corn time with them, and every other buck is drunk
on a ferment that they make of it. That Vasquez
could arouse them to almost anything, now.—Hey,
John?”</p>

<p>“Shore, them Injuns is bad medicine for all white
men in November!” quoth Big John sententiously.</p>

<p>They rode on in silence. A row ahead was tolerably
certain, Sid thought. If Vasquez had reached
them first by the railroad they would probably get a
hot reception!</p>

<p>Two hours later their cavalcade filed out of the
mountains and headed across a wide and hot plain.
It was like riding into an entirely new world.
Odd twisted and contorted cactus vegetation now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
covered the desert. Every plant and tree was different
from anything the boys had ever seen before.
Even the mountains were different, for instead of
having the usual foothills they rose, gray and jagged
and bare in the blue sky, abruptly from a flat and
sandy floor. A faint tinge of green on their sides
showed that the queer vegetation of this arboreal
desert climbed up for a considerable distance even
on that dry and inhospitable soil.</p>

<p>In front of them stretched a wide and flat plain,
clear to the bases of the distant gray mountains.
Sparse galleta grass and patches of gray sand dotted
with creosote bushes covered it. There were clumps
of mesquite, looking like dwarfed and twisted locust
trees; here and there a bright green patch which, on
riding closer, developed on to a <i>palo verde</i>, its bright
green branches and twigs a dense lacery of glistening
green. Sid rose close to one, looking for its leaves
for apparently it had none. They were infinitesimal,
spiky little things, adding nothing to its beauty,
which he saw came entirely from the <i>palo verde’s</i>
masses of sap-green branches.</p>

<p>As they rode further to the southwest, multitudes
of what looked like tall green fence posts appeared.
They covered the ridges, each as straight as a lance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
and as thick as a tree. They were small saguarro
or giant cactus, ribbed and pleated in green, and
covered with thorns. Further west they grew larger
and put forth branches like huge candelabra.</p>

<p>To Sid’s naturalist soul all this arboreal desert was
weird and beautiful and interesting. The tree choya,
a clubby specimen with stiff branches of thorn
bristles at the ends of crooked branches, began to
appear; then the ocatilla, the “Devil’s Chair,” as
Big John called it, a tree with no trunk but with
more arms than an octopus and each branch covered
with thorns and small green leaves bunched along
a green stem as hard as iron.</p>

<p>Towards evening, across the gray-green miles, a
small brown <i>visita</i> or mission outpost came to view.
It was merely a large hut of adobe, but the bell
in its upper tower told its purpose instantly. The
boys thrilled as they looked at it, for they were now
nearing the Papago Reservation and it was quite
possible that Vasquez had forestalled them by train
from Tucson.</p>

<p>Big John reined in the white mustang. “Nobody
to home, thar, these days,” quoth he. “The Injuns
is all away at the cornfields. We gotto ride in thar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
though, an’ help ourselves to water afore these
hosses kin go further.”</p>

<p>Sid would have preferred to keep away, but there
was no choice. Water was king in this country!
They <i>had</i> to get it, if it meant encountering a thousand
malignant school-teachers. Vasquez’s subtle
Spanish mind had no doubt led him to reason that
they <i>must</i> come here. But what redskin reinforcements
he might have picked up in that lonely mission
station imagination could not conjecture.</p>

<p>Slowly the miles lessened; the building loomed
up brown and enigmatical in the setting sun before
them. ’Dobe houses, each with a mesquite pole
veranda in front, appeared like magic among the
green stakes of saguarros on the hillsides; then a
round stone oven out in the valley near the schoolhouse
became plain to sight.</p>

<p>They were perhaps yet a mile away when around
the corner of the building appeared a man on horseback.
A cape or serapé of some sort hung over his
shoulders, but it was too far away to get any sense
of color from it. Niltci squinted his keen eyes and
gazed at him long and fixedly while the others
reined up.</p>

<p>“Mexicano!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Sho’ is!” agreed Big John. “I’ll bet my hoss
it’s that bird who tried to steal your tablet, boys!”</p>

<p>Sid and Scotty fumbled for their hunting binoculars.
A moment later they had trained them on the
man.</p>

<p>“It’s <i>him</i>, John, all right!” cried Sid. “<i>Now</i>
what do we do?”</p>

<p>The rider in the serapé answered that question
himself, for, wheeling his horse, he galloped off at
full speed.</p>

<p>“Ride, fellers! Burn it up!” roared Big John.
“We got about <i>no</i> time to git in thar an’ water our
hosses. He’ll be back, right sudden, with the hull
b’ilin’ of drunken Injuns!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

PINACATE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN a lather of foam the four horses raced in to
the deserted Papago village. ’Dobe houses
with small blunt chimneys dotted the hillside,
but there was not so much as a dog in sight. The
well was easy to find—a cube of palings built around
a curbstone to keep wandering burros from falling
in. It topped a low knoll and had a primitive windlass
lowering a bucket into its depths.</p>

<p>Ten minutes of sweating activity followed, Sid
and Scotty scanning the hills anxiously while each
horse drank his fill; the two dogs lapped up a hatful
from Big John’s sombrero; then all the canteens
were filled.</p>

<p>“Now roll yore tails, boys!” urged Big John,
flinging himself up on the white mustang. Sid
looked to his stirrups and mounted the pinto in a
running jump. Blaze and Ruler barked excitedly
as the horses clattered up a steep slope that led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
through a gap in the hills. What <i>might</i> be on the
other side of that ridge!</p>

<p>From its summit they saw a wide arboreal desert
stretching away below, bounded on the west by a
red, saw-tooth range of silent mountains. The rays
of the setting sun swept across the plain, lighting
up each saguarro pole in a spike of vivid green.
But over in the hills to the east was coming a long
file of riders—the Papagoes! They wound down
a defile, galloping at full speed, and a tiny horseman
swathed in a flying, striped serapé led them.</p>

<p>“Now, fellers, we shore got a race ahead of us!”
declared Big John. “We’ll make for Red Tank, out
thar in the middle of this valley. See them two
little ’dobe houses? That’s her. Head for them
ef any of ye git separated.”</p>

<p>Across the waste of creosote bushes, choyas and
giant cactus that was the Baboquivari Desert galloped
the whole party, heading due west toward the
red water pond which lies about the center of it.
Near its borders Sid could see the two ’dobe Papago
houses, still ten miles off, yet they showed as tiny
landmarks, even more noticeable than the many-branched
giant saguarros which dotted the plain.
Beyond them rose the Quijotoa mountains, abrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and sheer, bare as the ribbed sides of a cliff. They
were twenty miles away, but seemed quite neighborly,
a refuge to ride for, a place for a stand-off
fight if need be.</p>

<p>“Gee!—regular movie stuff!” chortled Sid to
Scotty as he looked back over his shoulder again.
Vasquez and his muster of motley Papagoes were
crossing from the east but had not gained a yard
on them yet. But they surely would, by the time
those ’dobe houses were reached! The horses could
keep their distance easily—at first. In time these
tireless Indian mustangs would ride them down, sure
as death!</p>

<p>“We’ll stop and stand ’em off from those ’dobe
houses, eh?” answered Scotty. “My old .405 will
be the boy then, you bet!”</p>

<p>“Won’t be no movie scrap, nohow!” growled Big
John back from where he and Niltci were breaking
trail. “The real thing don’t pan out that way. Ride,
fellers! All tarnation won’t stop these horses from
drinkin’ up the pond when we git thar, an’ we gotto
make time so’s to let ’em do it. You, Blaze,” he
stormed at the big Airedale loping along beside him,
“I gotto turn ye loose, now, spite of thorns ketchin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
yore coat. Cayn’t take no more chances with this
leader.”</p>

<p>Big John hauled up the huge furry Airedale on
his saddle as he rode, unsnapped the leash and let
him drop again. Twice before during the race the
white mustang and Blaze had run on different sides
of the same bush—with almost disastrous results
but he had been still more afraid of thorns catching
and holding the woolly-coated Airedale. Ruler had
no such danger. The big hound loped along easily
beside Sid’s pinto and his sleek sides passed the
thorns like silk.</p>

<p>In half an hour more of twisting and turning
through the arboreal desert seven miles of the distance
had been covered. They still maintained perhaps
two miles of lead over the Papagoes, in spite
of the furious urgings and gesticulations of their
leader in the striped serapé.</p>

<p>Big John glanced a sardonic eye back at him
occasionally. “Greaser—I’d plumb dote on stoppin’
a leetle lead with ye!” the boys heard him mutter
through his clenched teeth, as he galloped along.
“But them good old days is gone forever, now. We
gotto put up a tin-horn game on ye instead.”</p>

<p>Just what the hoax was going to be neither Sid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
nor Scotty could conjecture, but they knew Big
John’s resourcefulness of old. They rode on silently,
wondering, nursing the horses around the surprising
twists and turns that Niltci ahead saw fit to
make, usually to avoid great beds of bristly choyas.
Both the mare and the pinto were breathing heavily
now, and snorting in labored wheezes through their
foaming nostrils. The pace was beginning to tell!
The ’dobe houses loomed up not two miles off, but
behind them came that tireless knot of Papago riders,
light and lithe, and they could keep this up all day!</p>

<p>Then came a yelp of pain from Blaze. The Airedale,
in leaping to avoid a spiky choya, had slammed
full into a bushy acacia whose incurved cat claw
spines showed no intention of letting go again.
Doglike, he stopped still, waiting for his master to
extricate him and not trying to tear himself loose.
Big John let out a round oath and flung himself
from the white horse while the rest all stopped.</p>

<p>“Get out yore .405 and let her talk, Scotty,” he
barked, “she can outrange anything they’ve got, an’
this-yer dawg’s goin’ to make us take time out.”</p>

<p>Faint yells from their pursuers and the waving of
rifles by upflung arms greeted the stoppage of their
party. The cowman cut rapidly at the tufts of kinky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
hair that held Blaze fast, while Scotty yanked out
his big rifle and ran back a short way to hide behind
the cover of a giant saguarro. The distance
between the parties closed up rapidly; to one mile,
to half a mile, while Blaze whined and groaned,
with mute fang laid protestingly on Big John’s bony
hands as one by one the cat-claws were cut loose
from his coat.</p>

<p>Then the .405 whanged out and its bullets screamed
high in the air. A puff of dust flew up in front of
the Mexican rider’s mustang and he checked his
horse viciously. The Indians around him, looking
more like a collection of disreputable tramps than
the real thing, reined up and presently puffs of white
smoke came from them, followed by the faint pop
of their weapons.</p>

<p>At one of the shots Niltci suddenly threw up his
arms and tumbled off his horse. Sid gasped with
dismay, but to his astonishment the Indian boy was
now wriggling off through the sage like a snake!
He left his gaudy Navaho blanket behind, though,
and Sid caught Big John’s eye winking at him.
Evidently this was part of a ruse!</p>

<p>“You, Sid—make believe you was bending over
something,” grunted Big John. “Thar, Blaze, yore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
free, old-timer! Now bring me that flea-bitten
cayuse of Niltci’s, Siddy boy.”</p>

<p>Grinning, the youth held Niltci’s horse for him
while Big John flung the blanket over Blaze, lifted
him up on the saddle, and sprawled him out with his
collar tied fast to the pommel horn. “Come on in,
son!” roared Big John to Scotty as he threw a turn
of rope around the dog’s back and vaulted up on the
white mustang himself. “Now ride for all yore
wuth, boys!”</p>

<p>“But Niltci—how come?” gasped Sid. “Are we
going to leave him?”</p>

<p>“Never mind Niltci—he’s some busy, ’bout now.
Hep, boys!” retorted Big John, putting spurs to the
mustang. Indeed, as Sid looked around for him,
Niltci had disappeared as if the earth had swallowed
him up. He himself rode on lightheartedly. Shots
rang out behind them and the puff of sandspurts
kicked up the desert floor near by, but the Papagoes’
shooting was wild and the range a good deal too great
as yet. The four horses swung down toward the
first ’dobe house and Big John quickly led Niltci’s
cayuse behind it and stopped them all.</p>

<p>“Them Injuns <i>may</i> hev taken Blaze under the
blanket fer Niltci wounded—an’ again they mayn’t!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
We’ve got ’em guessin’ anyhow,” he grinned, peering
out around the corner. “Sid, you take the hosses
to the pawnd, an’ water ’em, while Scotty and I
sorter dally with these excited hombres a leetle.”
He dragged out his old meat gun, a .35 with a mouth
like a young cannon and a knockout punch. “C’mon,
Scotty, le’s mosey!”</p>

<p>Around the corner of the house they looked out
and back across the plain. The Mexican rider had
reined in at long rifle range. His Indians were
dismounting and creeping out through the bushes to
right and left while one of them held all their horses
by a handful of halter ropes. Finally the Mexican
also dismounted and joined them in the ambush
attack. Their idea was evidently to creep up close
and then carry the house by a simultaneous rush.</p>

<p>“Fooled ’em, all right!” grinned Big John.
“They shore think that Niltci got hurt in the
shootin’ an’ we brought him in hyar lashed to his
saddle. Let ’em come! You an’ I mought’s well
be a-sprinklin’ the sage, Scotty, so as to make it
more excitin’. Don’t shoot nobody—tain’t wuth it.”</p>

<p>He went to the other corner of the house and
opened fire with the .35. Nothing loath, Scotty tore
loose with the monstrous shout of his big .405. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
made a fine noise, and its bullets ripped and ricochetted
across the sand, throwing up small shell-spouts
like a naval gun. Answering shots and the
whizz and smash of lead bullets striking the building
told the youth that this was not all play. Whatever
story Vasquez, if it was he, had told the Papagoes
it had evidently aroused them to an unwonted fury.
It all seemed incredible, preposterous to Scotty. The
Bean-Eaters were the most peaceful of red men.
Were it not corn time he could not have believed
that they were really fighting in earnest.</p>

<p>“Got them hosses watered, Sid?” called out Big
John presently. “Bring ’em hyar; show’s comin’
off, pronto.”</p>

<p>Sid led the horses back under the shelter of the
house and ran to help in the defense. Shots rang out
in the sage, coming from both sides on their flanks.
It was getting high time to move on, before one
of the horses should be hit. Sid aimed carefully
behind a puff of white smoke that rose from a creosote
bush at his right, and let go with his .30 army
carbine. Before he could watch the result a yell
and a shout of laughter from Scotty spun him
around. Out there on the plain a funny thing was
happening. The Indian in charge of the Papagoes’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
horses had now apparently mounted one of them
and was riding off with the entire bunch!</p>

<p>It was several seconds before Sid realized the
truth—that that white rider with the red bandanna
about his forehead <i>could</i> be none other than Niltci
himself! While Sid had been shooting, the Navaho
boy had crept up through the sage, knocked down
the Papago holding the horses and ridden off with
all of them!</p>

<p>At sight of this disaster a chorus of vengeful
whoops rose out of the desert all around them and
two or three Papagoes leaped from cover in a futile
spurt to catch the runaways. Sid could have bowled
them over easily but he was instantly recalled by
Big John’s shout.</p>

<p>“Mount and ride, boys!” the big cowman was
yelling. He himself leaped up on the white mustang
and the boys followed hard after, riding along
the banks of the red pond. A flock of teal rose in
a great flutter of wings and there were yells and
imprecations behind them from out in the creosote
bushes, but they waited not to hear them. Big John
was guffawing so that he could hardly keep his
saddle. “Sing, redskins!—Yell, ye pisen horned
toads! Ain’t it a grand an’ glorious feelin’ to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
set afoot though!” he shouted back at them. “Gosh
durn it, boys, I ain’t hed so much fun since we
made Apache Sam eat a rattlesnake! Niltci an’ I,
we cooked up thet hoss-thievin’ stunt whilst ridin’
out hyar. Blaze, he jest nat’rally helped!”</p>

<p>As for Niltci, he was now making a wide circle
around the other side of the pond, leaving behind
him the screaming and fist-shaking Vasquez, who
stood in the sage searching his soul for Spanish
expletives that would relieve his feelings! Niltci
rode in to join them shortly after, with all the
Papago ponies following him and a broad grin on
his face.</p>

<p>“<i>Mucho bueno!</i>” he grunted. “What do with
pony?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll pilgrim along a while, an’ then drop
’em after dark somewhar near the Quijotoas,”
laughed Big John. “Fine work, Injun! I reckon
we’re shut of that outfit for a piece, eh, boys?”</p>

<p>“Not to be a crape-hanger, I’d say that we won’t
see another Mexican unless it’s a bunch of guerrillas
down near Pinacate,” said Sid.</p>

<p>“Shore! More fun!” grinned Big John. “Them
rebel greasers has Mausers—but they cayn’t hit
nawthin’ with them. Hope that Vasquez person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
aims to round ’em up an’ bring ’em along. ’Twell
be some fine li’l party, I’m settin’ hyar to tell ye.”</p>

<p>They rode on and dropped the Papago ponies
shortly before pushing through the pass in the Quijotoas
to Poso Blanco. There they encountered
a new village of Papagoes and the inhabitants lined
up to watch them go by. Big John, nothing loath,
bought oats from them, as friendly as friendly!
They, of course, had heard nothing of the row over
at Red Tank. Some of them even did their best
to sell the party baskets!</p>

<p>“Shore, but a runner from Red Tank will git in
hyar late to-night, fellers,” quoth Big John, as they
rode out on the desert once more. “This lot of
Injuns’ll be some surprised, I’m thinkin’! We’ll
water at Poso Blanco an’ pull our freight for ole
Montezuma Haid early to-morrow morning, or
the hull kadoodle will be on our heels.”</p>

<p>After dark a dry camp was made, in a patch of
mesquite and palo verde, a long distance out from
Poso Blanco. It had been a hard day of riding!
Fifty miles, in all, had they covered, and now the
country was changing from gray to red, and lava
began to show up, black and glowering under the
horses’ hoofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>It was sharp and chilly in the dark before dawn
when Big John roused out the camp next morning.
“Now, fellers, we’ll water for the last time at Wall’s
Well by sun-up, an’ then make a long pull through
the gap in the Growlers, which-same brings us to
Represa Tanks on the Camino del Diablo. You-all
hev never been thar, an’ hev no idee what it’s like,
but the Spaniards told the truth, fer once, when they
named it the Road of the Devil. Thar’s always
water in Represa, an’ from thare we kin work out
to Cerro Colorado, the first of them extinct volcanoes.
If Red Mesa’s twenty mile northeast of
Pinacate, as that pottery slate says, you’ll see her
from thar.”</p>

<p>The horses, freshened and invigorated with grass
feed and the cool of night, led off spiritedly, all
four riding together in a bunch. In two hours more
the sky began to lighten in the east and then a shaft
of red sunlight struck into living fire the top of a
mountain that rose ahead of them, solitary and
shrouded like a monk—Montezuma’s Head. Sid
held his breath in wonderment, to see the red bath
of color spread down the flanks of that huge and
imposing presence, widening and broadening its base
with color, bringing out the vivid green posts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
saguarros, the dark greens of creosote, and the white
patches of barrel cactus wrapped in their dense
mantles of thorns. They were in the heart of the
giant cactus country now. The floor of the desert
was dotted all over with them. Everywhere their
weird candelabra shapes stood like sentinels, upholding
bent and contorted arms, notes of bright
green on a gray and pale green waste.</p>

<p>As they rode nearer, Sid raised a shout of discovery.
“First organ pipe cactus!” he whooped,
pointing excitedly. “See it? Up yonder on the
hill!”</p>

<p>Out of a cleft in the rock rose a nest of what
seemed to be tall and crooked green horns, bunched
together like some coral growth of the depths of
the sea. A queer plant, but all this country was filled
with these dry-soil and water-storing species, and
nature did queer things with them to make them
able to survive.</p>

<p>Under the towering ramparts of Montezuma’s
Head the horses were watered and canteens were
filled. The wide flat stretch of arboreal desert across
to the Growlers lay before them. It would be
twenty miles of riding in the hot sun. Extra bags
of feed were bought and hung over the saddle bows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
before they started, and from a lone cowman, an
old settler who had come here for peace and quiet,
Big John borrowed a five-gallon canvas water bag.</p>

<p>That “valley” was a flat stage floor, surrounded
by an amphitheater of bare, granite mountains.
They rose all about them, interminable distances
away. Yet every mile of that crossing proved interesting,
for the boys never grew tired of studying
this abundant desert plant life. Saguarros in
troops and regiments marched up and over the
ridges or filled in the foregrounds of mesquite and
palo verde at appropriate intervals. Patches of
galleta grass that simply could not be ignored invited
the horses to a step and a munch of fodder.
Gambel’s quail ran through the bushes in droves
and caused many a chase and much popping of the
small six-shooters that the boys carried. An occasional
road runner darted through the creosotes,
long-legged and long-tailed. Desert wrens sang
from the white choyas where their nests lay adroitly
concealed from predatory hawks. It was high noon
before the Growler mountains were reached. They
rose abruptly out of the plain, so very steep and
sudden that Scotty was convinced that the foothills
that properly belong to all mountains <i>must</i> lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
buried in the sand underneath the horses’ hoofs. A
minute before, the cavalcade had been trotting
easily across a table-land like a hall floor; in the next
step the horses were laboring up a steep and rocky
trail that raised them higher and higher with each
step.</p>

<p>At an elevation of some eight hundred feet they
paused in a gap that broke through to the west
and the party spied out the land spread out like a
map below. Red and jagged mountains rose across
the flat valley of a red and scowling land below
them. A blue haze enveloped it all, out of which
rose dark purple cones of extinct volcanoes, hundreds
of them. It all seemed a black and purple
mass of peaked hills, devoid of vegetation, sizzling
in the sun. “Petrified hell,” Big John had well
named it!</p>

<p>As they looked, the haze of vapors shifted slowly,
and out of the far distances appeared for a brief
while a faint line of higher mountains, culminating
in a couple of smooth and wrinkly teeth etched
faintly against the blue.</p>

<p>“That’s old Pinacate, boys,” said Big John.
“Look hard at her; for you won’t see her again
for a long while yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Pinacate or bust!” said Sid solemnly. “Red
Mesa must be somewhere between here and it, then,
John, since we are now due northeast of the old
boy.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe,” retorted Big John, shaking his head.
“Search me! If thar’s a mesa, such as we have up
in the Hopi country, anywhere down hyar—I’ll eat
it! Hey, Niltci!”</p>

<p>The Navaho youth grunted negatively. He had
the keenest eyes of them all. If there <i>was</i> a mesa,
such as he was familiar with in his own country,
he would have been the first to spy it out and exclaim
over it.</p>

<p>“Welp! Let’s get movin’,” said Big John.
“Thar’s a leetle tank somewhere down this trail, ef
she ain’t gone dry. She don’t last long after the
rains in this country.”</p>

<p>He and Niltci started on down the granite, but
Sid and Scotty tarried to look out once more over
this lava land, iron-bound and torrid in the heat
of midday.</p>

<p>“Lord, what a country!” exclaimed Scotty, dejectedly.
He was disturbed to find himself frankly
afraid of it. Nothing here to exercise his constructive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
engineering instincts upon! Nothing—but
Death!</p>

<p>“To me it’s a challenge,” retorted Sid brightly.
“It’s still another mood of grand old Dame Nature,
of whose wonders there is no end! She cares nothing
at all for Man; but each new aspect of her is
a challenge to him to stay alive, if he dare. Doctor
Hornaday”—Sid pronounced the name with all the
fervor of boyish hero-worship—“he dared this
country once, and discovered that mountain sheep and
antelope had a refuge here. Those granite mountains
across from us to the north of Pinacate are
named after him. This lava looks good to me, for
it makes a game sanctuary of this country forever.
Except for your sake, old man, I’d rather there never
<i>was</i> a Red Mesa mine.”</p>

<p>Scotty shrugged his shoulders impatiently. He
was fast falling into a mood that had often been
fatal to him before, that of trying to rush a thing
through, jumping to a conclusion on presumptive
evidence and then acting on that conclusion immediately,
without trying out that homely old remedy
known as “sticking around a bit.”</p>

<p>“Well, le’s push through to Cerro Colorado and
have it over with, Sid,” he urged. “If there’s no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Red Mesa, the sooner we find it out and get away
the better.”</p>

<p>But by nightfall they had reached only Represa
Tank. It was an enormous run that their tired
horses had made, for that hot country, had Scotty’s
impatience only admitted it. The tank was a muddy
little hole with a small oasis of grass and a grove
of mesquites surrounding it. Near by was the
famous Camino del Diablo, the thirst-haunted road
to Yuma, one hundred and thirty miles away to the
west—all dry desert travel. Big John and the boys
sauntered out to look at it after supper. Up through
a gap in two red lava hills led the old trail, a sure-enough
road, as good (or bad) as the day it was
made. Looking southeast behind them, the thing
lost itself in the bushes of the Tule Desert. Why
or when it had been built, the boys had no idea.</p>

<p>Big John regarded it solemnly for a while. “Injuns,
Greasers, prospectors an’ sodjers—they all had
a purple time of it along this trail, boys!” he exclaimed.
“More’n four hundred people hev died
along this Camino del Diablo, of thirst, exhaustion,
an’ jist plumb discouragement.”</p>

<p>Scotty shook his head ruefully. “Let’s make a
break for that Cerro Colorado hill to-morrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
John,” he urged. “It’s about twenty miles northeast
of Pinacate, so Red Mesa <i>can’t</i> be more than five
miles from it and directly between it and Pinacate.
Ought to be a cinch to find it, if that plaque is O. K.
And, if we don’t, we’ll clear out, pronto, and waste
no more time on it, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never climbed Red Hill myself, son,” said
Big John. “But as for clearin’ out—we <i>cayn’t</i>!
Not yet awhile.”</p>

<p>Sid grinned delightedly. “How come?” he asked,
all interest.</p>

<p>“What think? Ef four men goes to chowin’
man’s food, in alligator-sized doses like you boys
hev been doin’ for the last four days, how long d’ye
suppose three skins of pemmican will last?” asked
Big John sardonically. “We’re almost out of meat,
boys. We’ll try Cerro Colorado to-morrow, an’
then, Red Mesa or no Red Mesa, we rolls our freight
for them Hornaday mountains whar thar’s mountain
sheep an’ antelope. Shoot or starve—that’s us,
old-timer!”</p>

<p>“Suits me!” caroled Sid. “We’ve got to stock
up before we start back, eh? Well—what did we
bring Ruler and Blaze along for, anyhow!” he demanded
enthusiastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Scotty was silent as they went back to camp. He
was silent, too, and anxious all through the ride to
Cerro Colorado next morning. Face to face with
the reality, with these vast fields of scowling lava,
with the dry and level plains of endless creosote
bushes, with these parched and stunted bisangas,
choyas, and saguarros, his dream shriveled and faded.
A mine! Here, in all this five hundred square miles
of barren lava! A railroad to it! How cross the
grim ranges of Pinacate, looming up now not twenty
miles away to the west? It all seemed so hopeless!
It would take a far sterner and more determined man
than he to push through such a project!</p>

<p>But Sid sang happily as they rode toward Cerro
Colorado. This wild, free land struck a response in
the deepest notes in his being, the love and enjoyment
of that freedom that every explorer, every pioneer,
every adventurer feels to be his most precious birthright;
for which he will sacrifice ease, comfort,
wealth, civilization itself. New species of this marvelous
desert life constantly claimed his attention.
White trees, fluffy in foliage as cotton, appeared.
“Smoke Trees,” Big John named them. A new
bush, all frosty white, met them along the march,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
securing a roothold even in crevices between red
and sterile lava chunks as large as a ragged rock
boulder. He recognized the species as the Brittle
Bush and would have tried breaking its twigs
except for the formidable and glistening thorns with
which it was armed. Then came a vast carpet of
lowly little plants that seemed made of frosted silver
and Big John drew rein. He inspected them closely
and then scanned the neighboring craters and all the
vast plain about him with keen eyes.</p>

<p>“Antelope fodder, fellers!” he announced. “Whar
ye see thet leetle plant, thar’ll be pronghorns. They
love it better than grass.”</p>

<p>No antelope were in sight, however. Even if
so, they would be quite invisible under that burning
sun. The horses loped on. Gradually there
rose out of the desert a low hill, sheered off flat
at its summit and covered with the dense lacery of
creosote bushes. Cerro Colorado it was, and they
picketed the animals out and began to climb its
rocky slopes. Rough, sharp lava, in boulders of all
sizes, marked the lava flow of geologic times from
this hill; indeed the whole plain below was made
entirely of the outpourings of this one crater. Once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
on its top they looked out over the country between
them and Pinacate, who loomed up grim and imposing
in the west and surrounded by his wide and
desolate lava fields. Twenty dreary miles away
was he!</p>

<p>Sid had carried with him the Red Mesa plaque,
bearing its enigmatical message in Latin which Fate
had not permitted them yet to have translated and
he now produced it for that last reading. The
words they knew were still there, staring up at
them from its red pottery surface.</p>

<p>“<i>XXI Milia S-O ab Pinacate—Minem aurum et
argentum—In Mesam Rubram</i>”—there was no mistaking
<i>that</i>!</p>

<p>But the more they pored over the words the more
unbelievable they became! It was surely a cruel
joke, a wild tale that the Papagoes had brought to
that old priest, Fra Pedro. It must be—<i>now</i>! For,
below them stretched a vast plain, stippled all over
with creosote bushes, clear to the base of Pinacate
itself, twenty miles away! There <i>was</i> no Red Mesa,
no hill of any sort on that plain! If those bearings
on the plaque were true, Red Mesa ought to be in
plain sight, right now, and not over five miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
away! But there was nothing of the kind, anywhere
in sight!</p>

<p>Scotty finally turned to look at Sid, silent misery
in his eyes. His dream had vanished. Already his
thoughts were turning to the future. His next
letter to his mother would <i>not</i> be the triumphant
announcement of a valuable claim staked out, a
triumphant return east to organize a company, but—well,
nothing much; nothing but perhaps a brief
note, saying that he had got a job somewhere.</p>

<p>Sid gripped his hand sympathetically. There was
nothing to say. If Red Mesa existed it certainly
was not here.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, old top; le’s forget it and go hunting!”
he grinned.</p>

<p>But Scotty’s tenacious persistence now came to
his rescue. He turned to Big John. “There’s a
mine around Pinacate <i>somewhere</i>, John, sure as
we stand here!” he gritted. “I doubt if the Papagoes
of that day knew how to tell that friar east or
west in Spanish very clearly. And a mine wouldn’t
be found in this lava but in granite outcroppings
if I know anything about mining. I’m game to stay
here and look for it, boys, while you’re hunting
sheep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Yaas, you pore lamb!” said Big John soothingly.
“I’ll tell ye: Them Hornaday mountains <i>is</i> granite.
An’ they’re twenty miles north<i>west</i> of Pinacate!
Put that in yore face an’ chaw it, if it’s any comfort
to ye.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

RED MESA</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ACROSS a bare and sandy divide wallowed
and crunched a weary party of horses,
men, and dogs. Bare and desolate mountains
surrounded them, and one rose in sheer gray
granite, capped by a black stratum of lava, apparently
two hundred feet thick. Of even desert vegetation
there was not a trace here. The sand buried
everything, even the mountain sides. One could
hear the faint lisp-lisp of it, moving stealthily along,
grain by grain, under the flow of the southwesterly
winds rolling up from the Gulf of California.</p>

<p>“Shore this is the country that Gawd jest didn’t
know <i>what</i> to do with!” ejaculated Big John, mopping
his sweating forehead and getting a new bite
on the corner of his bandanna with his teeth.
“Whar’s yore desert gyarden, hyarabouts, Sid?”</p>

<p>“We’ll come to it, just over the ridge—according
to the map made by the Hornaday expedition,” replied
Sid cheerily. For perhaps the twentieth time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
since they had left Represa Tank early that morning,
that little book-page map was taken out and scanned
by the whole party. Big John always liked to convince
himself, by standing on the map as it were,
that they were really following it. In these endless
dunes it would be easy to take the wrong gap and
miss MacDougal Pass altogether.</p>

<p>“See?” said Sid, pointing out the landmarks, “that
range ahead of us they named the Hornaday mountains.
They abut on the Pass in a right angle. I’d
give a lot to know what’s in that angle behind them!
<i>No</i> one knows. There’s a little piece of the earth for
you, Scotty, as unexplored as the North Pole!”</p>

<p>Scotty said nothing. He had not yet recovered
from the disappointment of finding Red Mesa apparently
a myth. The whole business looked worse
than ever now. Even assuming that the Papagoes
might have been confused in translating east and
west and so have given Fra Pedro the wrong compass
bearing, twenty-one miles north<i>west</i> of Pinacate
would be <i>right here</i>, where they were now riding—and
there was no such thing as a mesa in sight
anywhere! The mountains here were all of rugged
gray granite, tumbled and saw-toothed, with faint
tinges of green showing where some hardy desert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
vegetation had got a roothold. Mesa! This was
volcanic country, all cones or jagged outcroppings
of granite! thought Scotty, disconsolately.</p>

<p>He rode on dejectedly after Niltci and the dogs,
who were scouring the sand for game tracks. A
short way from here the first tracks of sheep had
been seen by the Hornaday party, and further south
antelope had been shot by John Phillips in the
craters of the extinct volcanoes which dotted this
country.</p>

<p>“There she is—there’s the Pass!” cried Sid
triumphantly, as they topped the last of the awful
sand ridges. His pointing finger showed them a
river of desert vegetation below, a broad and rolling
green river that flowed through the flat sandy plain
of the Pass in masses of rich, living color. Tall
green saguarros, like telegraph poles, rose in monumental
spikes along the granite bases of the mountains
on both sides. White fields of Bigelow’s
choya barred their way, in big patches of them flung
broadcast across the sands. Here and there the
bright green puffball of a palo verde made a note
of vivid color against the prevailing dark shiny
green of the creosotes. At sight of all that verdure
the horses broke into a run, twisting and threading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
through the flat bare sand lanes. The dogs, now
desert-wise, galloped along beside them, barking
excitedly and hardly noticing the choyas, avoiding
them instinctively.</p>

<p>And then Ruler gave tongue. <i>Ow-ow-ow!</i> he
sang, the first blessed musical notes of the chase that
had come from his throat since they had left the
Catalinas! Niltci whooped a shrill challenge and
lashed his mustang to full speed. After him put out
Big John, and then Scotty, glad of any excitement
to take his mind off his troubles. Sid rode leisurely
after them, merely glancing down at the tracks the
dog had discovered in the sand.</p>

<p>“Buck mule deer—a small one. Here, Blaze!—Heel!”
he called sternly to the Airedale, who had
started bounding after Ruler. Sid halted his horse
and watched the three riders racing down the Pass.
The frantic bellows of Ruler now told him that the
deer had been sighted, and presently Sid got a
distant glimpse of him, a tiny gray shape bouncing
stiff-legged as he dodged through the desert cactus
garden.</p>

<p>“Mule deer all right! Guess we’ll stay out,
Blazie,” he told the dog. “There are enough after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
him now to catch him with their bare hands! Let
us try for mountain sheep, meanwhile.”</p>

<p>He turned the pinto toward the base of the Hornaday
Mountains which rose in rugged gray-green
masses abruptly from the sand floor of the Pass.
Their summits were ridged with rough pinnacles of
gray granite. What might be on the other side of
those ridges at once intrigued the exploring instincts
in the boy. He was rather glad of this chance for a
lone investigating hike—with good old Blaze his
sole companion!</p>

<p>At the base of the mountain, where rock sloped up
steeply from sand, he checked his horse and a joyful
exclamation burst from him. An eager whine came
from Blaze, as he, too, snuffed in the sand. Here
they had discovered a regular mountain sheep runway!
The big cloven tracks, like pairs of roll biscuit
prints, were plentiful and deeply graven in the sand.
They ran both ways, but a vague impulse, coupled
with a decided penchant for climbing up and exploring
these mountains, led Sid to halt at the first lone
track that led off upward from the main game trail.
It was now nearly noon, and he knew that the sheep
would be high in the mountains at this time of day.</p>

<p>He picketed Pinto out on a patch of grass and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
started up on foot. Helped by Blaze’s nose it would
not be very hard to follow that track. Where a
print lacked in the rocky soil, eager barks from the
Airedale now led Sid on. They were climbing fast
and furiously before they knew it, the impetuous
dog leading Sid up and up the immense craggy
slopes. Below him the garden of the Pass rolled
out in a great gray plain. A mile down it the faint
belling of Ruler told him that the mule deer was
still leading them a busy chase. His own sheep
tracks were rising toward the ridge in a series of
steep bounds, climbing with ease where Sid had
to haul himself up or make toilsome detours to
avoid formidable white choya bushes. Sid hoped
it was a ram. Since the Montana hunt for the
Ring-Necked Grizzly he had not shot a single specimen
of that king of American game animals, the
Big-Horn. A Pinacate head, to match his Montana
one, would look mightly well in the Colvin trophy
den now located at their new ranch up in the Gila
Cañon.</p>

<p>Presently Blaze let out a volleying bray and
raced on up the rocks toward the ridge. There came
a clatter of rolling stones, and Sid looked up to see
a huge ram, followed by two ewes, silhouetted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
an instant against the blue skyline. Immense curled
horns encircled the big sheep’s head. For a moment
he stopped and looked back, his superb head poised
grandly, his horns branching out in regular symmetrical
spirals, his white ears standing out like
thumbs in front of the horns and his white nose,
cleft with the black mouth and nostril lines, a circle
of white against his brown neck.</p>

<p>Sid shouted to the dog sharply and raised his
rifle, but before he could steady the sights the ram
wheeled and was gone like a silent shadow. Blaze
yelped and roared out his ferocious challenge, then
at Sid’s repeated yells he turned and came back
whining with impatience. The youth began to feel
that Blaze would be a mere nuisance in this sheep
hunting because of his lack of experience. Ruler
would have circled craftily to head off the Big-Horn
and drive him back on the hunter, but Blaze
was always for the stern chase and the pitched
battle!</p>

<p>Sternly ordering the dog to heel, Sid climbed on
up cautiously and reconnoitered through the rocks
over the ridge. A shallow arroyo lay between him
and the next ridge, and beyond that he saw over the
mountain back, beyond a void of purple distance, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
flat red table of rock, etched sharply by the ragged
saw-tooth of the ridge between him and it. Sid
glanced curiously at that odd rock formation for an
instant, then his eyes swept the hollow below for
sight of that band of sheep. Blaze whined and
tugged frantically at his collar. He had seen them
already, long before Sid’s slower eyes could pick
them out in that mass of rocks and sparse vegetation
below.</p>

<p>“Gorry!—There they go! Steady, Blaze!” he
gritted through his clenched teeth and then raised
the rifle. The army carbine’s sights sought out the
game swiftly. Sid had filed a forty-five degree cut on
the front sight, so that it showed up as a little white
mirror over the flat bar of his rear sight. Cutting
the mirror square in two with the rear bar, he found
the galloping ram and raised it up to just under the
distant shoulder of the Big-Horn.</p>

<p>Sid was just on the point of pressing the trigger—indeed
had already felt the first movement of the
creep of its bolt action—when a bright, shiny, horizontal
flash,—the flash of an arrow—shot across
the gray slopes of the ridge opposite! The ram
staggered, stumbled, and struggled up a ledge, pawing
convulsively with his hoofs. A second and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
third arrow flash swept across the hillside and
stopped in the ram’s flank. Sid gasped with astonishment.
Those flashes were <i>arrows</i>! Then he
grabbed Blaze’s collar instinctively, put down the
rifle hurriedly, and closed his fingers around the
dog’s muzzle so that he could not bark.</p>

<p>Sid was too nonplussed for a moment to speak.
Arrows! It <i>could</i> not be Niltci, for the Navaho
boy had long since abandoned his bow, now that his
white friends kept him in unlimited cartridges. Sid
watched the ram in his death struggles, not daring
to move so much as his head. Those arrows had
been shot by some unknown Indian. These mountains
were <i>inhabited</i> then. He could see the two
ewes tearing wildly down the arroyo toward a grim
and scowling lava field that lay far below. They
disappeared around a corner of granite, some distance
down, but still the Indian who had fired the
arrows did not come out of his hiding place.</p>

<p>Who could he be? Sid knew that the Papagoes
had long since abandoned this hunting ground.
Their tank still remained, filled eternally from season
to season with rainfall, the sole reminder of
that time when the tribe used to gather here to
drive the sheep and antelope into the craters and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
slaughter them wholesale in the trap thus set. Now
the Papagoes had become a pastoral people, raising
corn, selling baskets, receiving their beef rations
from a beneficent government, which, however,
kept them virtually prisoners on two small reservations.
This Indian arrow-shooter <i>might</i> be a wandering
Yaqui from Mexico, but that was hardly
possible. It would go hard with him if caught on
this side of the border by any of our rangers!</p>

<p>Why did he not come out? Sid was sure that
it was because he had heard Blaze’s bark coming up
the mountain, followed by the appearance of those
hunted sheep. He was lying low.</p>

<p>For what? To shoot down the hunter the same
way that he had laid low the ram? Well, if he had
to wait all day, he would not be <i>that</i> victim, Sid
decided, then and there!</p>

<p>And meanwhile the ram lay a silent, pathetic heap
of horns and hoofs, lonely under the hot sun, surrounded
by the gray crags and green acacias that
had been his home—while the enigma of his death
remained still inscrutable. A stunted green saguarro
rose near where he had fallen, a marking-post of the
desert; the approach below him was guarded by a
sturdy choya, to stumble into which would be agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>For a long time Sid stood watching the place
where the arrows had seemed to come from, undecided
what to do next. There was a craggy boulder
over there, jutting out from the hillside, and behind
it strung out cover in the shape of creosote bushes
and rocky fastnesses of jumbled granite. But nothing
moved. The unknown Indian still lay hidden,
watching that ram carcass, too, like a trap set ready
to spring. Sid lowered his head slowly, inch by
inch, determined to play this waiting game to a finish
himself. His muscles were trembling from holding
his fixed poise so long and the under tendon of his
right knee ached.</p>

<p>It had never occurred to him that he was in any
danger himself—when suddenly a savage growl
rumbling in Blaze’s throat caused him to turn halfway
to the right. Instantly came the twang of a bow
and the sharp hiss of an arrow. Blaze bawled out in
pain, then sprawled out flat, with all four of his
furry paws spread out like woolly broom handles,
while his pained eyes looked up piteously to Sid.
An arrow transfixed him above his shoulders. The
dog seemed paralyzed as Sid dropped beside him,
hot anger welling up in his heart. A hurt to one’s
own person does not cause a whiter rage than one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
done to a dumb pet! Sid peered about him, seeking
with glittering eye for something to fire at. Beside
him Blaze moaned, sighed deeply, and then fell over
stiffly, the arrow sticking in the rock and partly
supporting him. Sid hesitated to pull it out. To
start the blood spurting free now would kill whatever
chance he had yet for life—if he were not
already gone.</p>

<p>It seemed a most cruel shot, to Sid. <i>Why</i> had
the Indian spared him and shot his dumb and faithful
companion instead? Then he began to glimpse
signs of wily red strategy in all this. The unknown
enemy intended to capture him <i>alive</i> if possible!
With Blaze at his side it could not be done by any
creeping attack, for the dog’s keen nose would immediately
detect the near presence of any person
whatever.</p>

<p>Sid looked cautiously all about him, finger on
trigger and rifle ready. To the south the saw-tooth
ridge rose high above him to yet loftier levels. All
about him were jagged pinnacles, rough and craggy
and full of hollows and rocky points which could not
be seen around. To creep back down the mountains,
somehow, and then fire three shots for help as soon
as possible seemed to him the best plan. He hated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
abandon Blaze while there was a spark of life left,
but would it not be better for them to be separated
anyhow, now? The dog might get away if he recovered
even if Sid should be captured.</p>

<p>That arrow that had pierced Blaze had come from
a rocky lair to the north of their position, just how
far away he could not tell. The hiss of it had really
been Sid’s first warning. Never again could he
forget that sharp, ghostly <i>whew</i>! Making for a
sheltering hollow which would be out of sight of the
rocky lair, yet be open enough for him to see around
him a short distance, Sid began to crawl down from
the ridge. As yet he had hardly moved, but his
heart was beating wildly. It seemed to him absolutely
hopeless to get away from this mountain with
he knew not how many hostile Indians all around
him. The very idea that this desolate land was
inhabited by even a small tribe seemed weird, uncanny.
Not a track save their own had they seen
so far. Even the old wagon ruts of the Hornaday
expedition had long since been buried in the sands
or washed out by the rains. It had been all new
country, all virgin. If an Indian band lived here
they could not be Papagoes, for the first one missing
from the reservation would call out a troop of soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
after him. Had Vasquez, then, already gotten
up from Mexico with some Yaquis?</p>

<p>Sid thought of all possible solutions as he crept
warily downhill, pausing before each craggy outcropping
in his path before daring to pass it. Then
a glimpse of something red which moved behind a
bush below to the left caused him to stop and raise
his rifle, and, while poised in the tense set of the
aim, a sudden, almost noiseless, rush of feet behind
him sent electric shocks all through him! There
was no time to even lower the rifle and turn around.
Subconsciously his leg muscles leapt out wildly. He
had an expectant sensation of a knife entering his
back—and then a thin band like a strap swept down
and across his eyes and something tight gripped
around his throat. Knees, and the heavy weight of
a man on his back, bore him to earth. His arms
sprawled out, dropping the rifle; his tongue shot out
and out, gagging fiercely against that awful halter
grip around his throat. Sid thought of the Thug
strangling cloth in that last instant before an enormous
drumming in his head gave way to blackness
clouding over his eyes. Then came the heavy thump
of the ground striking him, and unconsciousness....</p>

<p>It seemed but a very few minutes, the continuation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of some terrible dream, when his eyes opened again.
He was lying face downward where he had fallen,
and his lungs were pumping and sucking air in great
draughts, as if recovering from some endless and
vague period of suffocation. Blood was trickling
down his face and making a little pool on the rock,
while a cut or a bruise, he could not say which, over
his eyebrows smarted sharply.</p>

<p>Sid made a slight sound and attempted to turn
over. Two grunts answered him. Immediately a
strange Indian was at his side helping him turn over
roughly, and he learned for the first time that his
arms were pinioned behind. Sid looked up into the
buck’s face. It was round, hawklike and stern, with
narrow black eyes that had no pity. He recognized
the type as Apache instantly. There was none of the
stolidity of the Pima and the Papago in that face,
nor of the regular-featured, straight-nosed Navaho,
like Niltci, who resembled a copper-colored Englishman.
This man looked more like some bird of prey,
in the Roman hook of his nose and the craggy sternness
of his mouth. The first word he uttered as he
turned to his young companion confirmed Sid’s
thought, for it was in the harsh Athapascan dialect
of the Apache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>Between them they yanked the boy to his feet and
started up the hill. Nothing further was said.
They passed Blaze’s niche, the dog still lying on his
side, a pathetic furry heap dominated by the arrow,
and one of the Apaches pointed and let out a grunt.
The other nodded. Evidently they considered him
dead. They pushed Sid on down into the arroyo and
crossed to where lay the ram. The older man then
grunted a few words and at once set about paunching
the game. The younger led on with Sid.</p>

<p>As they topped the rise of the next ridge, that
same flat red rampart that Sid had noticed while
stalking the ram burst on his view. But now it
proved to be a really wonderful natural phenomenon.
Fire, lava, a tremendous outpouring of the bowels
of the earth had been at work here, no doubt during
that period when the craters were formed and it
had cast up that mighty red wall. Sid wished that
Scotty, with his knowledge of geology, were with
him now to study out the wonder of this vast red
rampart before his eyes. The whole interior angle
made by the bend of the mountains had been blown
out here by lava explosion, the huge granite strata
having been forced up on end like a pair of trap
doors, making two enormous red ramparts, vertical-sided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> 
and running out from the rocky angle of the
hills until their outer ends rose like towers. These
terminated the red walls, a thousand feet from the
ridge to the end of the lower gap where the lava had
burst out. At that lower end the ramparts rose at
least four hundred feet sheer from the granite slopes,
and a great apron of black and scowling lava ran
down from there at a steep slope, to lose itself under
the sands far below. But the walls were of sheer
granite, colored red by the fierce heat of that molten
lava of ages ago.</p>

<p>Red Mesa! Red Mesa! Red Mesa!—The certainty
of its being the lost mesa kept singing in
Sid’s ears as they descended. No such geologic formation
as this could exist anywhere around Pinacate
and not have been discovered before. Those
ancient Papagoes who had reported it to Fra Pedro
of 1680 no doubt had called it a mesa by reason
of its resemblance to the true mesa formation. But,
unlike the mesas of the north which are formed by
water scouring and erosion, the walls of this one
had been cast up bodily by the explosive force of
pent-up lava. Still, there was resemblance enough
to have given the place its name, Red Mesa, Sid was
certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>The young Apache kept behind Sid as he prodded
him on downward. There was no trail. His savage
guide avoided choyas and chose the best possible
routes for descent, that was all, while steadily the
giant wall of Red Mesa frowned higher and nearer
above them. Sid looked up as they approached the
base of the west wall. Flat slabs of bare, smooth
granite went up at a steep slope for perhaps a hundred
feet. Above that the red wall rose sheer to
fissured and turreted pinnacles three hundred feet
above the top of that awful slope. Inaccessible from
anywhere below was Red Mesa!</p>

<p>After more rocky descent they came around the
great tower at the lower end. Mighty and majestic,
like the belfry of some huge cathedral, it rose out of
the depths of the valley. A great smooth slope of
black lava, shiny and slippery as glass, formed a
slanting apron here, spanning the gap from tower to
tower. But what an apron! Like the face of a
dam, it spread across from one wall to the other,
closing a gap three hundred feet wide and itself at
least four hundred feet up to its edge, the towers of
the two walls rising for half their height above it
still. Geologically it was an imposing instance of
the unlimited power of Nature. When that mountain side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
had burst, the whole round world must
have shaken like a leaf and all the marine creatures
in the great seas to the north have been swept over
by a tidal wave of unexampled proportions! The
lava had flowed out and downward, cooling slowly
until this dam—for a cataract of fire—had formed
and remained as a grim witness to the stupendous
natural event that had once taken place here.</p>

<p>Sid, the educated white boy, had become so interested
in reconstructing the geological aspects of this
formation that he almost forgot the irksome tightness
of the thongs that still bound his arms and the
almost certain death to which he was being led. He
knew only too well from border history the ways of
the wild Apache! But the Indian guard behind him
had no other thought but his duty as jailer. While
Sid’s wondering eyes were scanning that giant apron
of lava that flowed down out of Red Mesa, the
Apache suddenly spun him violently around. Sid
had one whirling glimpse of a small black opening in
the lava above, looking like a ragged mouth, and
his curiosity about it had just begun to leap up overthrowing
the greater marvel of the whole cataclysm
of Red Mesa, when his head was forcibly held from
turning and his bandanna was whipped deftly across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
his eyes. The sandy plain below disappeared from
view, and in its place was now an impenetrable blackness.</p>

<p>Presently he felt the grip of two firm hands on
his elbows. A vigorous push set his feet in motion
to hold his balance. By the shortness of his step
and the upward lift of it Sid knew they were climbing
again. Often the Indian stooped down and took
hold of his ankles to guide his footsteps to some
secure place. Sid could tell by the opprobrious epithets
in Apache with which the young fellow belabored
him that he scorned Sid’s blind clumsiness and
was angry and intolerant, but Sid made no sign
that he understood the language. Once, though, he
nearly gave himself away, when the buck shouted
“Right!” sharply in Apache and Sid instinctively
moved his foot over that way, searching for a crevice
in the lava.</p>

<p>After a long and slow climb they stopped, and
Sid felt the Indian’s fingers gripping him strongly
around the back of the neck. It was useless to
resist. His head was being forced silently down,
and the boy submitted wonderingly. Then they went
forward, bent over again, and twice he felt the top
of his head striking bare and jagged rock above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
which cut painfully. Instantly he thought of that
little black mouth in the lava apron that he had caught
a mere glimpse of when the Indian was turning him
around. They were in that cave now, whatever it
was. It was hot and suffocating in here. Sid choked
for breath and sneezed as faint sulphur fumes pringled
in his nostrils. He had a sense of being urged
slowly upward. Now and again the fingers on his
neck would press him to earth and he would go forward
on hands and knees, where the least attempt to
raise his head would result in a painful scratch from
the tunnel roof that was evidently above them.</p>

<p>In time a draught of pure air began coming down
from somewhere above. Sid could see nothing, yet
with the buoyancy of youth he was strangely happy
and also consumed with curiosity. They would
probably stake him out and build a slow fire on
his stomach when he got up out of this tunnel, but
while it lasted it was all as exciting as exploring
it on his own would have been! More air and purer
came to him now. The sulphur fumes disappeared.
Something wooden like an upright log ladder struck
him on his forehead and the Indian raised him up
and called out loudly. Muffled voices answered him
from somewhere up above. Then he felt his guard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
stoop and lift him by the legs while invisible hands
above reached down and seized him under the armpits.
He was hauled up the ladder and then he
sensed being in some sort of a room—being guided
across it.</p>

<p>The indescribable sweetish odor of Indian was
strong in here. Sid had been so often in tepees and
hogans as to be able to recognize that smell instantly.
All the races of man have a distinctive smell of
their own, and the aboriginal ones, Malay, black boy,
yellow man and red Indian are all agreed that the
white man has a smell, too.</p>

<p>“White man smell like sheep!” as a Piute chief
had once truthfully put it! The odor of corn meal,
burnt feathers, paints and greases told Sid, too, that
he was in some sort of medicine lodge. It could not
have been a kiva, for the dank smell of damp stone
was wanting.</p>

<p>Then a sudden lightening of all the cracks around
that bandanna told him that he was in bright sunlight
once more. There was the perfume of growing
squash and melon and pepper, the faint odor of green
beans, the smell of grass—and of water! Red Mesa
was really a valley then, inclosed by two giant walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
and shut off from below by that ancient lava apron!
And it was inhabited by a band of Apache!</p>

<p>That much Sid’s sense of reasoning had told him
before the squeals of children and the cries of squaws
and shouts of men came to his ears. People were
all around him now, exclaiming in Apache, every
word of which he understood. Then the deep voice
of some one in authority came toward them and a
guttural command to untie him was given. The
bandanna was at once whisked from Sid’s eyes. He
stood for a time blinking in the glare of the sun.
High red walls rose up to right and left of him. A
large tank of water, almost a pond, filled much of the
basin between them, but there were strips of cultivated
plants along its borders, too, and here and
there he noted a grass Apache hut.</p>

<p>Sid fixed his eyes finally on a tall chief who confronted
him. The man’s features were round, heavy
and forceful, such as we are accustomed to associate
with the faces of the captains of industry among
our own people. His long, coarse hair fell around
his ears, tied about the brows with home-woven red
bayeta cloth. A single eagle’s feather sticking up
from the back told Sid that this man was a rigid
disciplinarian of the old school and a formalist in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the customs of his tribe, for it signified only one
coup, such as a far younger man than he would have
made in the old days. He wore a white buckskin
shirt, with the tails outside coming down nearly to
his knees. Long white buckskin leggins that disappeared
under the apron of his breech clout told
Sid, further, that this chief was a primitive red
man, or else had not seen white men for many years.</p>

<p>As Sid’s eyes still blinked, getting accustomed to
the strong light, a coppery grin cracked the chief’s
features.</p>

<p>“Well! I’ll be—! What have we here!” he exclaimed
in excellent English.</p>

<p>Then he turned angrily to the young buck at Sid’s
side and burst into a storm of guttural Apache
invective.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

THE SOUL OF THE INDIAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT torrential outburst which raged out
from the Apache chief seemed to scorch
and wither with shame the young Indian
buck who stood beside Sid. The chief was upbraiding
him in the most scathing terms in the Apache
language, as Sid understood it, for the folly of capturing
and bringing here a white man to their
stronghold. Sid’s own person was safe according
to Indian honor so long as he remained in the enemy
camp, but what to do with this white man, now that
he was here, would be a matter that only the old
men could decide in council. As for the youth,
whose name Sid learned was Hano, he was being
condemned to the direst penalties for his act. The
chief finally paused, arms folded across his chest,
and eyed the youth sternly, awaiting what reply the
culprit could make.</p>

<p>“The white man was spying on us, my father,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
replied Hano, simply. “It seemed best to take him,
lest he get away and tell others.”</p>

<p>“Why did ye not follow him, then? If he saw
nothing you could have let him go! If he saw—kill
and kill quickly!” thundered the angry chief.
“Die thou shalt instead!”</p>

<p>The youth hung his head, unable to answer. It
disturbed Sid strangely to learn that this boy was
indeed the chief’s son, and that this Spartan sentence
was being passed on him by his own father.
He himself would have pardoned Hano, for youth
does not think far ahead; it acts mainly on impulse.
That he, an enemy, might discover the secret stronghold
of an Apache clan and should therefore have
been slain or taken seemed to Sid, too, the natural
reasoning for Hano to have followed. Sid felt grateful
that he had, for some obscure reason, probably
the bond of youth itself, spared his life instead.</p>

<p>The chief, however, paid Hano no further attention
but turned on Sid those piercing black eyes that
seemed to look through and through him.</p>

<p>“Young white man, who are you and what is your
business down here?” he demanded sternly.</p>

<p>“My name is Sidney Colvin, son of Colonel Colvin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
U. S. Army, retired,” answered Sid, facing the
chief respectfully.</p>

<p>The Apache’s eyes widened for an instant, startled,
if such a stoic could be. “Colvin!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then all expression faded from his face. His
hand, however, rose, involuntarily to touch a gold
ornament that hung pendent from his neck. Sid
thought for a moment that a play of memory seemed
passing in the black inscrutable depths of his eyes.
Under that eagle gaze, though, he himself could not
long endure; in sheer embarrassment he dropped his
own eyes until they, too, fastened themselves on the
ornament. It was a gold twenty-dollar piece, pierced
with a small hole in its upper rim and hanging from
a rude chain of beaten silver. To Sid the curious
thing about it was that it was the sole thing of
white-man origin about the chief’s person.</p>

<p>“And your business?—a prospector, I suppose,”
said the chief, after another silent scrutinizing
interval.</p>

<p>“No, ethnologist,” replied Sid quietly.</p>

<p>“Ethnologist!” echoed the chief. An expression
of strong disgust crossed his stern face. “These
learned fools who misrepresent and misunderstand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the Indian worse than all other white men!—Pah!”</p>

<p>Sid was more than astonished at this outburst.
This Apache had evidently been well educated—once—perhaps
at Carlisle. Why, then, had he come
here to live with this wild band and become their
chief? That could wait; at present he was glad to
talk ethnology with this educated Indian, for Sid,
too, had felt that disgust over the stupidity and lack
of understanding displayed by the average ethnologist’s
treatise indicated in the chief’s tones.</p>

<p>“It’s astonishing how much they do misunderstand
you,” agreed Sid. “Knowing as they should
the Indian’s fundamental belief that all life, man, animal,
and growing tree, has a soul which is the gift of
the Great Mystery and returns to Him in the end,
how <i>can</i> they report your Indian ceremonials as
mere spirit worship, devil worship, sun worship—Gad!
It makes my blood boil!” Sid spoke vehemently,
warming up as his own indignation over the
vapid misunderstandings and the utter lack of comprehension
of most ethnologists’ reports enraged
him. “Chief, you know, and I know the Great
Mystery! As one of your own great men has said,
‘He who may be met alone, face to face, in the
shadowy aisles of the forest, on the sunlit bosom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
of the great prairie, upon dizzy spires and pinnacles
of naked rock, or yonder in the jeweled vault of
the night sky!’ Because the Indian is too reverent
to speak of Him by name, our worthy ethnologists
report that this and that tribe believes in no supreme
God, only in spirits—bosh!”</p>

<p>Sid’s eyes sparkled with the intensity of his feeling.
He forgot for the time that he was a prisoner
of a hostile tribe, in a desolate, barren region, far
from white habitation. The burning sense of the
injustice of even the best of us toward the Indian
swept him away. He spoke out his convictions, as
ardently as ever he had championed the Indian’s soul
before those white professors who had come to
study them here in the southwest—and had misunderstood.</p>

<p>The Apache’s eyes softened at the youth’s
vehemence. “My son seems to comprehend something
of us. It’s astonishing—rare, in one of your
race! I lived long among the whites—once,” he
smiled sardonically. “The massacre of my people
at Apache Cave, what think you of that?” he asked.</p>

<p>Sid realized that his attitude toward the whole
Indian problem was being tested out by this wily
chief; that upon his answer depended his life. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
he simply replied out of his own convictions, with
no thought of how it might affect his fate.</p>

<p>“A pitiable business, chief!” he answered. “Men,
women, children, all shot down to the last one! I
suppose it <i>had</i> to be, since you would not surrender.
The Army had its orders, you know.”</p>

<p>“Orders!” The chief drew himself up proudly.
“The Apaches <i>never</i> surrender, to injustice!” he
exclaimed. “I am Honanta, son of that Chief
Chuntz who fell in that fight, white man!”</p>

<p>Sid glanced up at him, surprised. “I always
understood that not one Apache escaped alive from
that cave——” he began, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“No! Let me tell you. There was <i>one</i> humane
officer among the white soldiers who entered that
cave of death, after all was over. He came upon
my mother, lying among the heaps of slain. She
still lived, shot in three places. She held me, an
infant, protectingly hid in her arms. A soldier
raised his gun to end her life—a wounded squaw
would be a mere nuisance, you know!”—the chief
interjected with bitter sarcasm—“but that officer
struck up his rifle. He had them take my mother
to the ambulances. And, out of the kindness of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
heart, that she might not die of starvation, he gave
her—this.”</p>

<p>Honanta raised his hand again to the gold piece.</p>

<p>A curious sensation of excitement went through
and through Sid. His own father, Colonel Colvin,
had been a young second lieutenant of cavalry in
that fatal fight of Apache Cave. But he had never
mentioned the squaw who had survived, nor the
twenty-dollar gold piece; in fact he had always been
most reticent about that battle, regarding the whole
subject with the most extreme distaste. Sid felt
that even if Colonel Colvin <i>were</i> that humane officer,
to attempt to establish his own relationship with him
and so gain immunity would be regarded by this
crafty chief as mere opportunism.</p>

<p>“The officer’s name, did she ever learn it?” he
contented himself with asking.</p>

<p>The chief smiled enigmatically. “My son,” said
he gently, “to-morrow I shall be able to give that
Sun Dance that I vowed to the Great Mystery forty
years ago. Is—is your father still living?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sid. “He has a new ranch up in the
Gila Cañon country. We came west again, after
I settled down to work with your people. The lure
of Arizona was always very strong with father.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Here was the scene of his early active days; here,
in that grand mountain region, he wants to live
until his time comes. It’s a great country!”</p>

<p>“Once more, then, before I die, I must leave the
Arms of the Great Mystery!” mused Honanta, more
to himself than to Sid. Then his whole manner toward
the youth changed and he motioned him courteously
toward his large grass lodge.</p>

<p>“The Arms of the Great Mystery!” So that was
what they called Red Mesa! thought Sid as they
walked toward the lodge. Truly, like great protecting
arms, those mighty red ramparts rose on each
side of this little valley, shielding this lost band
of Apache forever against further encroachment.
As to the chief’s remark about giving a Sun Dance,
it seemed to Sid that he himself appeared to be a
vital and necessary part of it. Whether he would
be a sacrifice in it or what part he would be called
to play in it was a mystery to him. To-morrow he
would know, though!</p>

<p>Sid entered the lodge with Honanta, Hano following
submissively. He looked about him curiously
at the giant hoops of ironwood overhead which
formed its arches, at the dense thatch of galleta grass
bundles which kept out rain and sun alike. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
was little furniture. A red olla, sweating cool water
on its porous surface, stood on a three-pronged
fork in a corner. A gourd dipper hung beside it
and at a motion from the chief Sid drank. There
were bundles of cane-and-ironwood arrows which
Sid noted were curiously tipped with native copper
heads. There were bows strongly backed with bone;
parfléche skins for storing dried meat and berries;
baskets holding shelled corn. From the rafters hung
strings of red peppers and dried corn ears, and loops
of dried squash. Shallow baskets held red beans,
specked with white dots.</p>

<p>Sid sat down on a roll of skins. Hano, who had
entered with them, still remained standing. He
seemed to be waiting for something, and Sid noted
that the chief had not yet ordered him to be seized
and bound. After a time, while the chief was
apparently thinking over some further questions, an
interruption came—the sound of a woman’s voice
crooning softly. She entered the lodge, beautiful
as the night. She was clad in soft white buckskin,
long-fringed, heavily beaded, and in her arms she
bore a tiny bundle from which came soft infantile
noises.</p>

<p>Hano’s bronzed face was working in agony of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
feeling as she entered. Sid and the chief rose respectfully.</p>

<p>“One boon, my father!” burst out Hano hoarsely
as the girl hesitated before them, the soft smile
of motherhood on her face.</p>

<p>“Which is?” queried the chief turning upon him
sternly.</p>

<p>“To perform the whispering ceremony for my
newborn son—before I die,” begged Hano brokenly.</p>

<p>Sid’s heart gripped him as he watched the tiny
bundle being passed across into the young father’s
arms. He hugged his baby close; then pressed his
mouth to the little ear that he uncovered. Sid
knew that he was whispering the name of the Great
Mystery into his son’s ear, the very first word of the
human voice that the newborn Indian babe hears. It
was an old, old ritual of ancient Indian custom.</p>

<p>Then: “Farewell, little one!” he heard Hano’s
anguished tones murmur as he passed the child
over to its mother. The girl started back and looked
at him astounded, then at Sid, and finally she turned
to the chief, her eyes dark pools of questioning.</p>

<p>“It must be, my daughter,” said Honanta. “My
son has erred grievously. It is for the old men
to decide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>He blew on a bone battle-whistle which dangled
along his thigh like a quirt. At the signal two warriors
appeared.</p>

<p>“Take him to the medicine lodge! Bind!”
ordered Honanta. He turned his back on Hano and
covered his face. A suppressed, hurt sound, like
some dumb animal mortally wounded, came from
the girl and Sid felt his throat choking. Hano
turned once more as they led him away.</p>

<p>“Farewell, Nahla!” his voice rang. “Bring my
little son to the stake, that he may see how a warrior
can die.”</p>

<p>For a long time there was a dead silence in the
lodge. Sid glanced from time to time at the stoical,
impassive face of the chief; then at the young wife,
who sat huddled in the rounded end of the lodge,
her newborn child in her arms and silent tears coursing
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Grief had stricken this lodge—and all because of
him. Indian justice was stern, inexorable; on the
same exalted plane as its religious conceptions, its
four cornerstones of Indian morality—Truth,
Honor, Courage, Chastity. For sparing him Hano
was to be punished. Was he, too, doomed to take
some awful part in to-morrow’s Sun Dance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Sid knew vaguely of the Sun Dance. In present
days it has degenerated among the Plains tribes
into a brutal material thing, a degrading exhibition
of suffering and endurance of no spiritual meaning
whatever. But in the olden times it had been a
thank-offering to the Great Mystery, vowed to Him
in memory of some special deliverance from peril
or certain death. But for the beneficent intervention
of the Great Mystery the man had lost his life; therefore
all the original symbolism of the Sun Dance was
of a potential death and a resurrection by the grace
of the Great Mystery. But why should Honanta
give this Sun Dance at this late date, forty years
after the massacre at Apache Cave? Because some
evidence of Honanta’s physical deliverer had come
to light, Sid reasoned. That, too, was necessary
for the full ceremony to be performed. If Honanta
knew that that humane white officer’s name was
Colvin, his own part in the ceremony was obvious.
What then of Hano? Could he be destined for
some heartrending sacrifice on Honanta’s part? It
was possible! Sid decided to rescue him, to get him
out of Red Mesa and send him to Big John for
help, if he would go. He planned, now, to find out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
where the medicine lodge was and then act when
the time was ripe.</p>

<p>Its location was shown him in the most unexpected
manner.</p>

<p>“She was a wonderful woman—my mother!”
exclaimed Honanta suddenly, breaking his reverie
and apparently continuing his narrative as if no
interruption had occurred. “She escaped with me
from that ambulance by night, for she had no wish
to be brought a captive to the reservation that was
then being allotted to my people. In the mountains
we lived, together. She built a hut of sweet grass.
She recovered from her wounds, healing them with
plants taught my people by the Great Mystery. She
fished and hunted like a man, carrying me always
with her on her back. She taught me to love and
respect the birds, who live very close to the Great
Mystery. As I grew up, she taught me to know the
animals, our brothers; to sing chants for their
souls when I had to kill them for our needs. She
taught me to reverence the bears, who are our
mother clan by the First Man. Silence, love, reverence—these
were my first lessons in life. Through
her I learned to know the Great Mystery. To pray
daily to Him after the morning bath, silently, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
arms outstretched facing the sun, which is the most
sublime of His creations. To seek Him on the high
places, alone. To see Him at night, through the
glory of the stars.”</p>

<p>Sid listened, waiting respectfully while the chief
paused again, sunk in reverie. As an ethnologist he
was learning the true inwardness of the Indian’s soul
from a red man’s own lips. For some reason
Honanta seemed to have laid hold upon his sympathy
and he now poured it all out as to the first white
man who really comprehended the fundamentals of
that marvelous Indian creed now lost to mankind
forever.</p>

<p>“As I grew up, our broken-hearted people turned
to Christianity. It seemed to us the only thing the
white man had which promised mercy and hope,”
went on the chief. “I went to a mission school. I
learned of Jesus—a man after our own heart! I
read the Bible, which, please remember, was written
by men of my race, by men of the East—by no one
of your blue-eyed, conquering people who now
dominate the earth. I saw the white men preaching
the Bible with their lips, but their lust for money
and power, their eternal buying and selling was
always there. I saw that their lives flouted the Bible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
at every step. I became disgusted. I knew that
the teachings of Jesus and our own ancient religion
were essentially the same. We used to <i>live</i> those
teachings, too, long before the white man came. So
I determined to return to our ancient faiths and
customs. When I became a man I wandered in all
desolate regions, seeking a spot where the white man
was not. And I found it. Here, in this forgotten
and inaccessible stronghold, which I named ‘The
Arms of the Great Mystery,’ for they protect us
forever. Here I brought my mother, and as many
of her clan as I could find. One by one, they escaped
from the reservation and joined me here. These are
all that are left of the great Yellow Bear clan of
the Apache.”</p>

<p>Again came a silence. Sid felt strangely moved.
He was torn between his duty to Scotty, his friend,
and his new sympathies for this hunted band of a
once free people in this their last refuge. For those
copper arrowheads had told him that there <i>was</i> metal
here; that Red Mesa really had a mine, as was reported
by the Papagoes. His friendship for Scotty
prompted him to find this mine and tell him its
location once he should escape. Yet, to destroy the
peace of this last band of the original red children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
of our country, to give over their last stronghold
to the lust and greed of the white miners who would
surely come here—could he do it, even for Scotty’s
sake?</p>

<p>“And here my mother died, full of years and
honor,” went on the chief. “Come; I will show
you!” He led the way out of the lodge. Along the
borders of the deep, blue-green waters of the tank a
path led to the substantial brush shelter built up in
the interior juncture of the two high red walls.
Every pole and stick of it had evidently been brought
up from the surrounding desert, for no trees grew
here, all the available soil having been given over to
cultivation. Inside the house Sid saw all the ceremonial
objects of the old-time Indian mystery
dances, marriage basket trays in intricate designs
of black, white, and red on the willow, baptismal
bottle baskets made watertight by piñon gum, medicine
bundles filled with healing herbs. And, in one
particularly sacred shrine, the chief showed him a
row of small bundles which Sid knew at once were
mortuary relics. They contained the hair and perhaps
a few mystic possessions of the dead of the
tribe. The first bundle of these was heavily decorated,
as if all the women of the band had lavished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
their art and symbolism in bead work upon it in
loving memory.</p>

<p>“My mother’s!” boomed the chief’s deep voice,
laying his hand on it.</p>

<p>Sid removed his sombrero and looked reverently.
After a time he let his eyes wander around the dim
recesses of the room. The chief remained standing,
lost in reverie before the reliquary bundle of his
mother, but Sid’s eyes searched for and finally
found Hano, seated bound against a post in a dim
corner under the rocky walls between whose fork
the medicine lodge had been built. That there was
a concealed opening in this rock somewhere near
which led to the cave tunnel up which he had come
the youth was sure. He examined the place keenly
for an instant, and then turned and stood awaiting
the chief’s further pleasure.</p>

<p>“My white son is interested in the ethnology of
our poor people? Why, then, does he come down
here, around Pinacate, where there <i>are</i> no Indians?”
asked the chief as they went out the door.</p>

<p>That was a knock-down poser for Sid to answer
without time to think it over! How could he disclose
the real object of their trip—mining, the seeking
of this very Red Mesa mine? Yet he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
not plead ethnology as the purpose of <i>this</i> trip! To
lie, to evade, would be impossible before those keen
eyes that read truth unerringly. To lie and be
caught in his own trap by the wily chief would
mean death, under the ancient Indian customs under
which this band lived. A murderer, with them,
might be pardoned, if he could show sufficient cause,
but a liar was always summarily dealt with, for no
one in the tribe felt safe with him who spoke with a
forked tongue.</p>

<p>“I have a friend,” answered Sid, after a pause in
which Honanta stood with his eyes searching his
to their depths, “I came with him. His reason for
visiting Pinacate is not mine to tell you.”</p>

<p>The chief smiled slightly. “It is good. Friendship
of man for man is our highest test of character.
He who betrays a friend, even under torture, is unworthy.
How many of you are there?”</p>

<p>“Four,” said Sid. “One cowman guide, the white
boy who is my friend, a Navaho youth and myself.”</p>

<p>The chief looked relieved. Evidently he did not
consider those three out there somewhere in the
desert particularly formidable, nor that they could
easily find Sid.</p>

<p>“Go, my young brother! You are free of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
village. You cannot leave it, for the entrance is
well guarded. We shall wait until my old men have
spoken.”</p>

<p>Honanta turned and stalked back to his lodge,
leaving Sid free to wander at will. The youth at
first regretted that he had not told the whole truth
about his party, that he had neglected to mention
the most important member of it—the dog, Ruler,
who would surely track him here just as soon as Big
John and Scotty started back to look for him. They
would arrive at Red Mesa to-morrow morning, and,
guard or no guard, Ruler would lead them to that
cave mouth! There was no doubt of his own rescue.
But it might mean a fight, might mean anything
once Big John arrived on the scene! And for
Scotty, with his acute mineralogical knowledge, to
get one sight of Red Mesa would mean the end of
the Yellow Bear clan’s peaceful days. There were
two things for him to do now, Sid decided; to free
Hano, and to escape himself—after which he could
think out what further steps to take.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Sid strolled around the pond
under the high walls of Red Mesa. He looked
curiously at the small patches of maize, growing in
clumps very much as the Hopi plant them; at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
borders of beans and peppers; at squash plants that
ran riot up the stone walls, growing out of small
crevices of soil in the rock. Every inch of soil was
being cultivated. As it was the dry season, great
woolly clouds of lavender and rose, empty of rain,
were flying across high over the red ramparts in the
blue sky. A few squaws were irrigating the higher
plants, carrying up large jugs of water from the
pond.</p>

<p>A little further on he came to a deep gorge, cleft
in the high rock, and Sid stopped, his heart beating
swiftly. Here was the mine described on that Red
Mesa plaque! It ran like a fissure through the
granite, a wide seam of black lava trap, and with
it was a vein of rich, dark ore. Pure copper smelted
out by the heat of the lava glinted a dull black
throughout the vein, and a still intenser black, gleaming
with points of white, told of native silver nuggets
mixed with the copper. It was a big lode. It
swept downward, passed under the dirt path under
Cid’s feet and descended into the dim blue depths of
the tank. Here was Scotty’s mine, all right!</p>

<p>In it two Apache were working now, making
arrow points at a primitive forge up in the shadows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
of the cleft, blowing a welding heat on a small pot
fire with a bellows made of the skins and horns of
the mountain sheep. They looked at Sid curiously
and one grunted an exclamation in Apache at the
other, but neither spoke to him.</p>

<p>Then there was a commotion in the village. A
hunter’s song came deep and resonant, from the
depths of the medicine lodge. Presently there
emerged two stalwart bucks, bearing the carcass of
the ram that Sid had seen shot before his eyes that
morning. The three arrows that still stuck in his
side identified him for Sid. In addition its body
was now gayly decorated with prayer sticks and
symbolic feathers signifying thankful remembrance
to the Great Mystery who had given them this food.
All the village turned out rejoicing at the hunters’
song. From the grass huts came squealing children,
laughing girls, and lithe young men, all sunburned
black as negroes which gave Sid the idea that most
of them had been born here. The procession came
shouting and rejoicing along the path bordering the
pond and then all followed the ram’s carcass into a
large lodge down near the open lower end of the
valley where evidently the old men of the council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
were to make the appropriate prayer—“Spirit, partake!”
the Indian grace—over the game before
dividing it among the band.</p>

<p>Sid watched them depart. It seemed to him that
a good time to act had now come. Honanta had not
appeared. He was evidently in his lodge or else in
a vapor bath hut near the pond preparing himself
for his Sun Dance. One of the squaws had left her
water jug standing by the brink of the tank, and it
gave Sid the solution of a problem that had been
troubling him for some time. He shouldered it
and then walked swiftly toward the medicine lodge.
There was no doubt now that the opening to the
cave tunnel came out there, for out of it had just
been brought the slain mountain sheep. He got to
its door unperceived by any one and walked swiftly
to the rear recess, his eyes rapidly accustoming themselves
to the gloom within.</p>

<p>“Hano!—Shall I free you?” he asked in Apache,
as he groped his way to where the young buck sat
bound.</p>

<p>The Indian youth stared. If surprised at Sid’s
speaking his own tongue, he gave no sign. Then
he shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“No: I await my father’s judgment,” he replied
proudly. “An Apache does not run away.”</p>

<p>“But listen, Hano,” said Sid, earnestly, “my people
will surely come! They have a hound dog who
can track me here. They will be very angry and
there will be a fight. You are few, and my people
are armed with revolvers and repeating rifles. There
will be many killed, and all for nothing. But you
can get by the guard down below. I cannot, without
a fight and perhaps killing one of your people.
You must go. My horse is tethered over at the foot
of the mountain. Give him this water jar for me;
he must be crazy with thirst by now. Then ride
until you find my people. There are three; a big
cowman, a boy like me, and a young Navaho. I
think they are at Papago Tanks. Tell them that
there is peace, and to come quickly.”</p>

<p>A long wait ensued while Hano considered.</p>

<p>“Besides, Hano—Mexicans are coming. We’ll
need white men with rifles if your home is to be
defended,” urged Sid, playing his last card.</p>

<p>“My brother speaks wise words,” said Hano at
length. “Cut, white boy!—I go!”</p>

<p>Without waiting a moment more Sid drew his
hunting knife and freed the young Apache. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
with a delicacy that forbade him to take any advantage
of Hano’s escape to find the tunnel entrance,
he turned his back and waited. There was
a faint rustling; then he turned around to find Hano
and the water jar vanished from the lodge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

BLAZE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was perhaps an hour after Sid and his
Apache captors had gone by that Blaze finally
came to. The dog moaned feebly; then he
tried to rise to his feet. An aching, burning pain
shot through his shoulders and there came a sharp
twinge as the arrow jerked loose from where its
point had stuck in the rock.</p>

<p>It galvanized Blaze to frenzied action. He could
not know that that arrow, passing through just
above the spinal vertebræ, had temporarily paralyzed
him with the shock of its blow. All his doggy understanding
realized was that this awful thing burnt
like a fire and must be shaken loose at once. At
first he thrashed about recklessly trying to break it
off or get rid of it, somehow, if rolling and plunging
could do it. Then he snapped at the arrow ends
savagely, shearing off point and feathers like the
ends of a straw.</p>

<p>This spasm of frenzy ended in a mad bolt down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the mountain in search of Master. Big John was
Blaze’s idol; the one human who knew everything
and always gave him the most glorious times of his
life. When hurt before, it had been always Big
John, his man-partner of their hunts who, strong
and tender, had somehow made his hurts come well.
Sid, as Little Master was all right, but Blaze hardly
gave him a thought now, for this trouble was too
terrible and he <i>must</i> find Big John! Trembling all
over and yelping every time the arrow stub struck
against a passing bush, Blaze struggled on down the
hill. The bone tops of his shoulder blades rubbed
against this inexorable Thing that stuck tenaciously
through the flesh above them and at every step they
hurt worse than grinding a raw bone. Again and
again he felt himself growing weak and giddy with
the pain of it. Each stumble was to him an agony
of roaring and helpless rage. Heroic, stoical old
Blaze, who had fought bear and mountain lion times
innumerable; been bitten, slashed, mauled with
clawed paws; who had lost one ear in a fight with
a timber wolf—he found this thing to be the most
maddening of all his experiences with pain. You
could not fight back nor get hold of it, after that first
savage crunch of his jaws had bitten off all the arrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
that could be reached. It rode him thereafter like
a spur that never let up.</p>

<p>Blaze’s progress grew slower and slower. At
times he would stop and howl dismally for some one
to come and help him. Then, after a grim and
expectant period of waiting, he would crawl on
again, floundering and tumbling down the steep
flanks of the mountain. In time he reached the
plain, where they had started up after the ram.
Here was Sid’s pinto, and the animal whinnied
eagerly for he was already thirsty and weary of
waiting for their return. Blaze’s nose led him back
to the tracks of the main party, where the familiar
scent of Big John’s white mustang at last smote
his nostrils.</p>

<p>It put new heart into the dog. Master’s horse!
Now we were getting somewhere! He trotted on,
enduring the pain in his shoulders stoically until it
faded to a general dull ache. Nothing brushed the
arrow stub, now. You went carefully around
bushes and kept to the mustang’s trail, avoiding all
thorns and cats-claws. Several miles further on he
came to where the buck had been shot and butchered.
The bones and pieces of raw meat left behind smelt
good, but Blaze was feverish and would not eat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
His doggy instincts told him to starve out that fever.
What lashed him most terribly now was the scourge
of thirst. He had lost a good deal of blood, although
the arrow had cut nothing vital. Water! He <i>must</i>
have it!</p>

<p>Big John and Scotty had ridden on toward
Papago Tanks with the buck on saddle after the
kill. They had not waited for Sid, for it was their
custom when any one went off lone hunting not to
expect him back before nightfall. Blaze followed
on after the white mustang’s tracks, sore and weary,
his tongue hanging out with thirst and a high fever
raging in him. Oh, to find Master! <i>He</i> would
know! He would get him a canteen or something!
To drink and drink and drink! To have cool
strong hands draw out this burning pain that seared
his shoulders like a hot iron! Only the indomitable
courage of his breed kept him up. Blaze was a
thoroughbred. He did not know what a streak of
cur blood was! Kootenai Firebrand, Culbertson
Rex, Champion Swiveller, all famous lion dogs of
the West, were among his forebears and they would
not let him give up. He staggered on, his feet
wabbling crazily under him as the trail wound on
southward through a country of black lava cones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
all around him, with vitrified and scoriated lava
under foot.</p>

<p>Then Blaze stopped, for the horses had halted
here. He looked wearily up toward a huge cone that
rose to the east of him. Up that way these tracks
led, and he must follow, too!</p>

<p>He arrived at the top, at last, and then gave a
feeble yelp of joy. Here Master had got down off
his horse, and the smell of him was sweet in Blaze’s
nostrils! Below him stretched out a vast amphitheater,
the sandy floor of a deep crater that was half
a mile across. Through a gap in the opposite side
the desert vegetation had come marching in, species
by species, saguarro, bisanga, choya, creosote bush,
to spread out on that wide floor three hundred feet
below and cover it with green dots of vegetation.
Blaze looked down, his doggy heart sinking with
misgivings, for no one was down there. Could he
<i>ever</i> muster up the strength to climb down into this
thing? And where had Master come up out of it
again? Only one set of tracks led down here and
the descent was as steep as a chimney.</p>

<p>A wild, fresh odor decided him to attempt it. At
his feet he snuffed hoof tracks, small, pointed, with
musky dew claws—a deer of some kind, Blaze decided.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
He did not know that they were antelope,
for the smell was new to him, but at once the old
hunting ardor surged up in his soul, overriding
weariness and physical pain. He attempted a valiant
bark, which sounded somehow hoarse and dry in his
throat; then he plunged down the steep declivity after
the horses. Around him rose high rim rock, red
and purple and black. These two lava gaps were
the only places where the crater could be entered
at all. They all had gone down here; that was reassuring.
Here, too, were Ruler’s tracks, that four-footed
companion whom Blaze secretly envied for his
marvelous nose and openly despised for his absurd
caution in attacking bear and lion. Here also was
the smell of Indian, where Niltci had jumped off
and led his mustang down by the bridle. And here
Master and the other Young Master had dismounted
and climbed down, side by side, their horses following
most unwillingly as their sliding tracks showed.</p>

<p>On the crater floor the party had separated and
there had been gallopings about in every direction.
Blaze followed the white mustang, for she bore Master,
his beloved. Soon he came upon a long smoky
cartridge from the old .35 meat gun, and the mustang’s
tracks veered sharply over to the right. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
smell of fresh blood came to Blaze’s nose and he
wabbled slowly out to the center of that vast volcanic
pit following the scent. A pile of entrails,
shank bones, blood dried up by the thirsty sands—that
was all, for him, of the antelope that had been
shot here!</p>

<p>Blaze lay down, completely tuckered out. Without
at least a drink of life-giving water he could
not go a step further. The assembling and galloping
tracks that led off up to that other gap told
which way they had gone out. He could <i>never</i> make
that ascent, now! Instinct told him to wait until
sundown, for it was hot and sultry down here now
and there was not a breath of air. He lay down,
panting, consumed with thirst. When he tried,
later, to rise again he found that his wound had
stiffened and the whole top of his shoulders seemed
one raw, immovable lump.</p>

<p>He looked about him piteously, then raised his
muzzle to the sky in a howl of dismay. Silence, of
the brooding desert; and then an answer—the wild
howl of a coyote! Blaze’s quick eye singled him
out sitting up there in the gap, watching him wolf-like.
His answering howl had not been of sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
or anything like that, but to call other coyotes
to help him prepare for this feast of dog flesh!</p>

<p>The danger stiffened Blaze up and strengthened
his moral fiber. A savage challenge rumbled in his
throat as he rose stiffly to his feet and faced the
coyote menacingly. Then a whine of pain came
from him. He could not fight, now; but he would
not howl again for help, at any rate! That signal
was too well understood by these wild dogs that <i>had</i>
no master!</p>

<p>Blaze looked up at the coyote and then around him
again. Should he climb up there and fight this
fellow, anyhow, weak as he was, before any more
of them came? He could never do it without, first,
water! Then his eye fell on a small round brown
object lying near by on the sand. He walked
stiffly over to it and snuffed it. That thing was
what his men drank water out of! It smelt of the
young master, too! Scotty had forgotten his canteen
during the butchering of that antelope and left
it behind, but all Blaze knew about it was that the
thing smelt of him and held water. He rolled it
over with his paw. An enticing splash came from
inside. Instantly all that pent-up thirst torture
burst out of him in a frantic effort to get at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
water inside. He took the canvas case in his teeth
and worried and shook it savagely. Of no avail!
The cork held tight, and the thing dropped on the
sand, the water inside tinkling maddeningly. Blaze
stopped a moment to consider. This thing was
something like a bone, really! It <i>had</i> a bone, of a
kind, its spout, sticking out one side. He lay down,
with his paws on the body of the canteen, and then
began to chew and gnaw fiercely at the cork and tin
of the nozzle.</p>

<p>An Airedale’s jaws are the most formidable part
of him. Those inch-long tushes can give a frightful
slash, and with them two of the big 60-pound
western Airedales can pull down a mountain lion between
them. Blaze’s teeth closed on that canteen
nozzle like crushing paper. The metal gave; the
cork squeezed. A savage pull on it, a shake that
would take the ear off another dog, wrenched it loose
and broke away the solder in its joint. A thin
stream of water began to trickle out through this
crack as the canteen lay on the sand—and under it
ran a long red tongue, curved like a spoon, lapping
up greedily every drop as it flowed out!</p>

<p>After that Blaze felt better. He lay down awhile.
The matted cake of dried blood and hair around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
arrow kept any flow from starting again, even with
fresh water making new blood in his veins. It was
getting cooler now. A huge circle of shadow began
rapidly to creep out from the west toward the center
of the crater. The coyote had moved down a
hundred yards nearer. Another was singing his
shrill song up on the rim, and working around
stealthily to join the first one in the gap.</p>

<p>Blaze got up, growling. He was very stiff and
could only move those shoulders by enduring intense
pain, but immediate attack was his best defense now,
and he knew it. Steadily he climbed up the gap
through the river of desert vegetation that flowed
down its slope. The coyote was waiting for him,
silent, crouched for a spring. His green oblique
eyes glared at Blaze menacingly, as he drew near—his
teeth were bared in a wicked snarl.</p>

<p>Blaze increased his speed, heading straight for
him, snarling savagely. The coyote was a little
larger than he, but Blaze and Ruler had tackled the
great timber wolf together, and he was not in the
least afraid of him! At ten paces off he suddenly
let out a volley of ferocious terrier barks, vengeful
with the fury of the lion, terrifying to the creature
attacked. Then he charged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>That coyote did not wait! That savage attack,
even by a wounded dog, was too much for his cowardly
nature! There was a squeal, a yelp, a bawl
of pain as Blaze’s fangs laid open his shoulder to
the bone—and then a gray streak vanished through
the creosotes so fast that nothing but a greyhound
could have overtaken him!</p>

<p>Blaze loped on, grim, dogged, determined. The
sun was setting now, and travel would be more endurable.
Scotty’s canteen had given him new life.
He was going to win through to camp if he had to
bring in every coyote in the desert after him! The
trail wound down around the flanks of the crater
and brought him back to the sands again. From
there it went on, mile after mile, while a grand and
beetling mountain range loomed up nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>Blaze felt himself growing weaker again. The
sand had given way to the most awful of broken
black lava under foot, rough and sharp beyond description.
The horses had picked their way over
it with difficulty; to the weak and wounded dog it
was a purgatory of toil and it took every last ounce
of strength out of him.</p>

<p>Darkness fell. Blaze could see fairly well in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
dark, and he needed to, here! Thorny ocatillas,
devilish choyas and stunted bisangas that were balls
of sharp thorns outside, had to be seen and avoided
if he would save his eyes. Twice he lay down and
gave it all up. Only the steadily freshening scent of
the white mustang’s tracks gave him courage to rise
again and keep on.</p>

<p>Then great walls of ragged black rock loomed
up, dark and forbidding, ahead in the gloom. It
seemed the end of all things to Blaze. What in all
the world was he coming to! He stopped, shivering
all over with the sharp cold of the desert night. His
wound ached unbearably. He lay down puzzled,
wearied at the mere sight of this hideous black rocky
mass ahead. It was perhaps the tenth time since
leaving the crater that he had done so. Blaze
groaned and gave up the pursuit of Master in a final
disconsolate howl.</p>

<p>But this time the barking challenge of <i>another
dog</i> answered, sounding faintly in his ears!</p>

<p>Blaze raised his head. Ruler! He knew the
hound’s voice well! He got up, yelped a hoarse,
throaty cry and crawled on. Ruler’s challenge grew
more and more menacing and then there came the
sound of men’s voices. And then Master’s voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
ringing out, stern and vibrant: “Halt, thar! Is that
you, Sid?” it asked.</p>

<p>Blaze gave a joyful little moan and crawled feebly
into camp, licking humbly at Big John’s boots.
Ruler, puzzled, snuffed over him, after trying an
abortive attempt at a romp. Then the water-hunger
became too strong for Blaze to endure longer
and he crept on to where a tank glimmered under
the stars, a rock-bound pool in the lava, and there
he drank and drank and drank until his dry tongue
could lap up no more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Stand back, fellers! Fotch hyar a light. No,
Sid!—and somethin’s happened to Blazie boy,” called
out Big John’s voice in the dark. Niltci stirred up
the camp fire, and presently Scotty came out of the
boys’ green wall tent bearing a candle lantern.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be plumb teetotally <i>hornswoggled</i>!”
roared Big John, as the light fell on the back of the
drinking Blaze. “Shore, he’s all bloody! An’ he’s
got a stick through his neck— Come hyar, Niltci!
We gotto see about this! Sid’s shore got hisself
into trouble—dern his pesky hide!”</p>

<p>Niltci made his peculiar exclamatory noise and
sprang over to where Blaze still lay drinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“Arrow!” he pronounced after a moment’s inspection.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be durned!” grunted Big John. “Shore
of it, Injun?” he questioned incredulously.</p>

<p>Niltci nodded. Then, stooping and holding
Blaze’s muzzle with his fingers, he gave a quick
yank which drew out the shaft. Blaze groaned
through his set teeth. His blood came in a stream
and they were busy for a short time getting a bandage
on it. Then the Indian picked up the arrow
and examined it more closely.</p>

<p>“Apache!” he declared.</p>

<p>“No!” roared Big John. “<i>Cayn’t</i> be, Niltci!
They ain’t an Apache between hyar and the White
River country. I’m a gosh-durned fool, I am, an’
proud of it—I’ve lost one of them ornery boys, an’
some one has shot my dawg—but ye cayn’t hand me
that Apache stuff, nohow!”</p>

<p>“Apache!” reiterated Niltci, with more emphasis.
He pointed to the blood grooves on the shaft in confirmation.
All tribes make them in their own peculiar
spiral lines.</p>

<p>“What in the world’s happened to Sid, then,
John?” queried Scotty, his awed, scared face appearing
in the circle of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Search me, hombre!” grunted Big John. “You
Blaze, ef you could only talk, now! But fellers, we
gotto set down a-piece and figger this all out the
best we kin. Sid ain’t back, but Blaze is; and with
an arrer into him. What does it all mean? I <i>told</i>
you I was a fool!” he vociferated.</p>

<p>“Ruler’s the answer, John,” said Scotty, as they
all went back to the camp fire carrying Blaze between
them. “We’ll put him on the back trail right
off and then we’ll know something.”</p>

<p>“Good haid, li’l man!” agreed Big John. “I’d do
it, to-night, only we jist cayn’t work them hosses
over that lava in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I’m</i> going to, now!—on foot, too!” said
Scotty truculently, his Scotch dander rising. “It’s
only about three miles back to the crater where we
shot the antelope and I left my canteen. We’ll
walk. Suppose Sid followed our trail there and got
ambushed by some wandering Yaquis? You know
how they hate the Mexicans. All whites look alike
to them.”</p>

<p>“Apache!” grunted Niltci stolidly.</p>

<p>“All right; Apache, then!” conceded Scotty.
“Sid’s in trouble with Indians somehow, and Blaze
managed to get away and get here, with that arrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
in him. Niltci can stay here and look after him
and the horses. As for me, I can’t get back any
too quick!” declared Scotty, with the vibrant sympathy
of youth in his tones. “Here, Ruler!”</p>

<p>“Hol’ on thar, Scotty! Yore fixin’ to miss three
bull’s-eyes in a row, thar, son. Of co’se I’m goin’,
ef you are; so we’ll sorter git organized, fust.
Whar’s that rucksack? We-all mought be gone
three days, an’ Sid he’ll mebbe want medicines an’
bandages. By rights I ought to take Niltci and
leave you hyar, Scotty, seein’ as this is Injun
doin’s.”</p>

<p>But Scotty was obdurate. Start he would, that
night, and, as some one had to stay with Blaze and
the horses, he insisted on it being Niltci. That
didn’t suit Big John, for in a raw iron land like
this the Indian boy was worth a dozen Scottys to
him. The row gathered way, but you might as well
argue with one of the lava boulders around Papago
Tanks as try to convince a Scotchman!</p>

<p>“Wall, s’pose you and Niltci do this-yer pasear,
then? An’ I’ll stay,” said Big John, testily, by way
of settling it. “Mind you don’t go further’n that
crater, though, an’ then come back an’ report.”</p>

<p>There being no further objections, Niltci and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Scotty soon set off into the night, leading Ruler on
a slip leash. Overhead swung the brilliant stars of
an Arizona night, a glory of soft light in which
crater cones, rugged lava pressure ridges and stunted
saguarros sticking up out of the rocks showed dimly.
Behind them the grand range of Pinacate rose
gloomy and majestic, the eternal cloud of sulphur
vapor around its summit blotting out a whole section
of the star canopy to the south. Niltci led on noiselessly,
picking his way by eyesight that was as good
as a cat’s in the dark. They passed white smoke
trees, ghostly as clouds, in the darkness, growing
in company with white brittle bushes out of dry
crannies in the lava that could hardly support a
cactus.</p>

<p>An hour later they were toiling up the steeps of
the crater once more. So far, not even a whine of
discovery had come from Ruler. Big John had
given them the hobbles of Sid’s pinto, to show the
scent to the dog when the right time came to try
to make him understand what was wanted. But
Niltci himself knew the pinto’s tracks by some obscure
difference in the hoof-mark, and he assured
Scotty that so far not a sign of Sid’s horse had they
come upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“He may have come down into the crater from
the other gap, though,” objected Scotty; “we’ll go
down and get my canteen, anyhow.”</p>

<p>They climbed down into the vast coliseum of the
crater. It was dark as a well down there, and Niltci
crept along on all fours, following the pony tracks.
He pointed out Blaze’s paw prints as they went. The
dog had been here, too, following their party of the
afternoon. After a time Scotty gave a yelp of discovery
and pounced on a round brown object lying
on the sand.</p>

<p>“Here’s my canteen, anyhow!” he crowed. “I
left it here after we butchered the antelope.”</p>

<p>Then a cry of surprise came from him as he
stopped dead and held out the canteen to Niltci to
examine. It was empty of water and the crooked
angle of the spout showed that it had been cracked
open. “It was more than half full this afternoon,
I’m sure of that!” insisted Scotty, excitedly. “Some
one’s been here beside us—but why did he not uncork
it, then?”</p>

<p>Niltci looked it over keenly.</p>

<p>“Dog! Blaze do it. Him chew canteen. Him
have come a long way,” was his verdict.</p>

<p>He showed Scotty the dog’s tooth-marks and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
replaced the canteen where Scotty had picked it up.
There the whole story written in the sand was clear.
Here Blaze, wild with thirst, had lain down with the
canteen under his paws and chewed at it until he
had worried the spout solder loose.</p>

<p>“Dog heap thirsty! Got arrow back in mountains,
me think,” declared Niltci.</p>

<p>“Back in the Pass? You’re right! That’s about
five miles from here. I’m game to walk it and find
out something. First, though, Niltci, we’ll climb
up the other gap and trace Blaze out of it. He
didn’t come out by the east gap, that’s sure. Sid
may have been hunting in some crater to the east
of us.”</p>

<p>They started up that long slope down which
flowed the river of desert vegetation. Their own
tracks of the afternoon were here, and Blaze’s, too.
The certainty that he had simply followed them out
that way and then turned to the south became
stronger as they climbed up. It was settled as sure
at the summit of the gap, where Blaze’s paw prints
showed that he had made the turn around the crater
just as they had.</p>

<p>Scotty and Niltci stood side by side, holding in
Ruler who was whining eagerly now, crazy to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
chasing the coyotes which were howling in the desert
all around them. The blood-and-scent story of
that one which Blaze had routed when he had attempted
to bar his path had excited Ruler, and he
had got into his doggy mind the idea that coyote
was to be the night’s game. Otherwise this whole
proceeding was still a mystery to him!</p>

<p>Around them under the stars brooded a black and
silent land, dead as the surface of the moon, the
wide, flat and parched plain of the lava fields
stretching away for fifteen miles to the east. Near
by rose the jagged edges of the Rainbow Range,
ragged saw-teeth which would be red and purple in
the daytime. Now that range was barely distinguishable
under the faint light of the stars.</p>

<p>But, as they looked, suddenly a tiny point of fire
shot up on the far horizon to the east. It was high
enough among the lower stars to surely be on a
mountain or crater of some sort, yet so tiny and far
away as to be almost indistinguishable in the desert
haze.</p>

<p>“There’s Sid!” shouted Scotty triumphantly,
gripping Niltci’s buckskin-clad arm. “Now, how
in the dickens did he ever get way over there? And
if so, why did not Blaze come in by <i>this</i> gap?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>Niltci stared at the flickering point of light for
some time without replying. At times it died down
to a mere red coal, so small as to be lost to eyesight
entirely. Again it would flare up and appear quite
strong.</p>

<p>“Mexicanos!” declared the Navaho boy at length.</p>

<p>“Mexicans!” echoed Scotty amazedly. “Why,
that’s Sid’s camp fire, Niltci. Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No. Fire, he was be on Cerro Colorado. Master
Sidney, him no have go <i>there</i>!” answered Niltci.</p>

<p>In a flash Scotty saw that he was right. For no
conceivable reason could Sid have gone that far distance
to climb Cerro Colorado again. No; he had
gotten into some sort of adventure with some wandering
Indians back near the Hornaday Mountains,
that was sure. Blaze’s tracks all argued that. The
dog had got away, wounded, and had followed their
own tracks to camp, step by step.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of this Mexican camp fire on
Cerro Colorado? It could only mean one thing:
Vasquez had taken the train to Nogales in Mexico;
had assembled a band of guerrillas; and they had
ridden west by Sonoyta and Santo Domingo along
the Sonoyta River, and now had climbed Cerro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Colorado—for the same reason that Scotty and Sid
had—to find Red Mesa!</p>

<p>And they had been disappointed. What would
their next move now be? Scotty quivered with excitement
all over as a possible solution of that question
now came to him. Suppose the Mexicans were
to push straight across this lava field for Papago
Tanks! It was only fifteen miles in an air line.
Bad going across the lava, but the Hornaday party
had done it, and these Mexican riders could get across
in just three hours after daylight!</p>

<p>Vasquez was not the man to give up a mine like
Red Mesa without scouring this country for it, and
Papago Tanks would be his natural base for such
an expedition, Scotty argued to himself. These
guerrillas would be upon them, then, by noon to-morrow!
And meanwhile they themselves were
now on the wrong side of the border. It was a case
of get out, and get out quick! But where to? One
thing was certain: Sid was back somewhere near
the Pass. Their whole party must “roll their
freight,” as Big John would say, back there early
next day, and leave no tracks behind them at Papago
Tanks.</p>

<p>Tracks! They had left a million of them, written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
plain in the sands, and there would be no rain to
wash them out for a whole season yet. The more
Scotty thought it over the more certain he was that
F-I-G-H-T! was sure to be the outcome of all this!</p>

<p>“We’ll get back to camp, right sudden pronto,
Niltci!” he cried. “Mexicans is right. That’s
Vasquez and Company, you bet! Le’s go!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

HANO</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEARING the water jug for Sid’s pony,
Hano descended that sulphur-fumed tunnel
up which he had led the white boy not
three hours before. It was now late in the afternoon;
it would be nightfall before he could find
the horse and ride. At the cave entrance one scout
was on guard, a young fellow like Hano himself,
not yet twenty. He rose respectfully as the chief’s
son came by.</p>

<p>“Ai, Hano!” he greeted, for he had heard nothing
of the disturbance up in the village. He did not remark
on the water jug nor question Hano about it,
for such would have been contrary to his whole
training. Only squaws asked idle questions.</p>

<p>Hano nodded and went on out. No one saw him
from the lava basin brink, for the entire band was
gathered in the council lodge for the sheep meat
distribution. He climbed up the mountain side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
following his original course downward with Sid,
and soon disappeared over the ridge.</p>

<p>From there Hano began tracking Sid over on the
Pass side. He noted with some surprise that the
dog was now gone, but that did not matter much.
Hano’s face was set in a brown study of thought.
He resembled his father, Honanta, strongly. The
face was young and keen, with the high bony cheeks
and the hard, thin facial muscles of youth, but it
would acquire the same fullness as Honanta’s with
growing years. Indianlike, Hano was considering,
not his own personal interests but his duty toward
his tribe. To aid them he had broken his honor—that
honor which required him to await the judgment
of the old men even if unbound and free to go.
It was repugnant to him to take the step because of
Sid’s words, but his duty to the tribe was paramount.
The main thing, as he saw it, was to keep
<i>all</i> these white men from ever discovering Red Mesa—The
Arms of the Great Mystery. The white boy
had spoken of Mexicanos coming. Hano knew them.
Occasionally, not often, small parties of them had
visited this region. They usually came by the Sonoyta
River, following it until it lost itself in the
sands to the south of Pinacate. From there they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
generally went to Represa Tank, from which the
Camino del Diablo led them safely away from the
mountains of Red Mesa. Only once in a great
while had the Apache found it necessary to abolish
one of these Mexican gentry who had become too
inquisitive.</p>

<p>The white boy had told him also of a hound
which could track him to Red Mesa. Hano doubted
this not at all, for he had often heard in the lodge,
of a winter’s night, stories of the far-famed sagacity
and the wonderful tracking nose of this dog of the
white man’s. He would like to have a dog like that
himself for tracking mountain sheep. To capture or
to kill him was one of the things that Hano decided
to attempt.</p>

<p>Thus far Hano’s plan had reached only the point
of determining to watch both parties and to act for
the best. If one party of whites killed the other it
would be a fine thing, for that would leave this
white boy alone in Red Mesa, and he would never
be allowed to leave it alive. Hano hoped that he
would eventually consent to adoption into the tribe,
for he seemed a fine youth and his heart was good,
too, or he would not have remembered his pony’s
thirst and brought that water jug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>His name, too, was in his favor. <i>Col-vin!</i> How
often had Hano heard that name on his father’s lips
when the story of that young white officer of long
ago had been told! It was a sacred name in the
clan. Because of it alone Honanta’s entire attitude
toward this white youth had changed, Hano knew,
before he himself had been led away to the medicine
lodge. This young Colvin, too, had set <i>him</i> free
and begged him to bring his friends to Red Mesa
because the Mexicanos were coming. That was all
very well, but Hano decided that he would <i>not</i> do
that, except as a last resort. Better let them all kill
each other; then there would be no one but the white
youth to deal with.</p>

<p>By this time Hano had climbed down the mountain
on Sid’s trail and found the pony. It was after
dusk, and the familiar plain of giant cactus and
creosote bush, of choyas and mesquites was dark in
the shadows cast by the surrounding mountains, but
the pony, a piebald, was easily distinguishable, picketed
in a trampled ring of galleta grass. He had
scented Hano, for an eager whinny came from him
and Hano met the pony tugging at his lariat and
thrusting out bared teeth and thirsty lips toward him
in dumb appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Pinto drank the water in that jug down in one
huge suck. Then Hano untethered him, coiled the
lariat and rode off, following his tracks back to the
main party. Darkness fell as he followed the pony
prints to the kill of the mule deer. Two hours of
slow trailing under the stars led him to the huge,
bare craters where, up the eastern one, the tracks
now led.</p>

<p>Hano walked the horse up the steep slopes, listening
in the dark constantly for a sign of these other
white men. He paused at the crater edge and looked
down. A vast mysterious black cistern was that
crater well!</p>

<p>Hano halted the pony and listened, for faint voices
were coming up to him from below. They were
down there! Presently the <i>Hoo-ooo!</i> of a hound’s
throaty challenge rang out. The dog was below and
facing him, Hano knew instinctively from the direction
of that sound. He drew back and waited.
More voices; words in the white man’s tongue.
After a time he heard them climbing out slowly
through the other gap. They stood on the opposite
brink, one voice talking excitedly, audible in the dead
of night even across the crater. Then they rode on.</p>

<p>Hano followed down into the dim cavern, crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
its sandy floor and worked his horse up the opposite
gap. There, far to the east, he discerned a flaring
watch-fire, over on the Red Tepee, as his tribe
called Cerro Colorado. So that was what these
white men had become excited about? he exclaimed
mentally, as he watched the fire awhile.</p>

<p>“Ugh! The Mexicanos!—Those that the white
youth told me of!” decided Hano finally. As he
watched, tiny flares began to move down the hill
and out northwards on the plain. Hano counted
twelve of these lights, moving slowly north apparently,
though they were being carried by men on
galloping horses. Immediately he divined it. Those
lights were torches, carried by the Mexicans to see
choyas ahead, and they were moving for Represa
Tank!</p>

<p>From there their next ride would be either up
the Camino del Diablo or—to his own mountains!
And the white boy said they were coming!</p>

<p>What for, Hano did not know, but immediately
all his plans underwent a sudden revolution. This
must not be! There were twelve of the Mexicanos
and only three of these other whites. The whole
neighborhood from here to the Pass was filled with
pony tracks made by the white boy’s friends. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Mexicans would be easily victorious over only three
of them, and then the tracks would lead them to——</p>

<p>His mind made up at once, Hano started the pony
at once around the crater in the direction the white
men had just gone. To combine with them, to
bring them to Red Mesa and have their help in defending
his home was his people’s only salvation—just
as that white boy, Col-vin—blessed name!—had
said.</p>

<p>But to ride on into a strange camp was entirely
against Hano’s Indian training. It might end in
being shot or some other absurd mistake. The thing
to do, now, was to get in touch with this Navaho
that the white boy had spoken of. He was an
Indian and both tribes spoke the Athapascan tongue.
Aided by the sign language they could understand
each other. The Navaho was the one to meet first!</p>

<p>Hano halted his pony. He could not be very far
behind these whites now. He sent out his voice in
the challenge of the big-horn ram, for he knew that
the Navaho would understand that unnatural voice
in the dead of night as a signal. Then he waited,
his eyes alert, ears listening eagerly.</p>

<p>The bellow of a hound far ahead was his first
reply. Then silence, profound and unbroken. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
a short wait a man rose suddenly out of the ground
before him. He pointed a rifle full on Hano:
“Who are you?” he demanded in Navaho.</p>

<p>“Friend!” replied Hano, giving the peace sign.</p>

<p>The Navaho did not lower his rifle. “That pony?
Where did you get him?” he asked sternly.</p>

<p>Hano explained rapidly in Apache, much of which
the Navaho understood. He had scarcely time for
more when the swift click of hound nails and the
angry bellow of Ruler came out of the night. The
dog rushed up toward Hano, barking savagely,
tugging along Scotty who was holding back with all
his strength on the leash. To a dog all strangers
are enemies!</p>

<p>“What’s all this, Niltci?” queried Scotty—“Good
Lord!”</p>

<p>He stopped astounded and stared up at what was
evidently a strange Indian on Sid’s horse.</p>

<p>“Apache!” said Niltci. “Him come from Master
Sid. Say all right. Must come quick.”</p>

<p>“Is Sid hurt?” asked Scotty grimly.</p>

<p>“No. Him with Apache. Wants us to come
quick,” reiterated the Navaho.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be darned! Keep your eye on him,
Niltci—it may be some damned ruse. We’ll take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
him in to see Big John and see what <i>he</i> says about
it,” decided Scotty.</p>

<p>Walking on each side of Sid’s pinto, with rifles
poised and ready for any treachery, they took Hano
back to the camp at Papago Tanks. Big John roused
out at their coming and threw a heap of brush on the
fire.</p>

<p>“Jeemently-ding!—what you got thar!” he called
out as the party came in. “An Injun on Sid’s pony!—whar’d
ye git him?—Say, fellers, I’m just sufferin’
for the news!”</p>

<p>Scotty told him all Niltci had been able to learn
from Hano during their march and then added the
tale of their own discovery of the Mexicans.</p>

<p>“Shore’s a fine mess you’ve got yore old uncle
inter!” grinned Big John. “Them greasers is on
Cerro Colorado, you say? Waal, <i>we</i> left our tracks
on thet li’l hump, too! If it’s that Vasquez, he’s
followin’ ’em now—to see whar we went next, sabe?
He won’t make fer these here lava diggin’s nohow;
he’ll make for Represa! An’ he won’t lose no time
over it, either! Then they comes inter the Pass,
same’s we done. We’ll meet ’em thar, plumb bright
an’ early to-morrow morning. They’ll be ridin’ all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
night. Thet fire ye saw on Cerro Colorado was
jist a guide for night ridin’.”</p>

<p>Hano nodded in confirmation. He told Niltci now
that he had seen lights moving north across the plain
before he left the crater rim.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” exclaimed Big John. “We rolls
our freight out’n hyar right sudden pronto! An’
it’s goin’ to be a sweet fight, if we don’t git up into
the mountains before that bilin’ of greasers comes
a-fannin’ and a-foggin’ through the Pass, old-timer!”</p>

<p>Dynamic was that decision of Big John’s! The
tent came down in a jiffy; the horses were roped and
saddled; Blaze was made comfortable up on Sid’s
pony, a bed being built for him of every available
blanket piled on the folded tent for a base. With
Hano leading off through the dark, the cavalcade
started at once back across the lava.</p>

<p>The horses’ shoes clinked on its flinty surface;
ghostly desert vegetation and tumbled masses of
petrified lava bordered their trail. After several
hours of careful riding came the huge cones of the
craters, moving by like grim phantoms past them as
slowly light began to dawn in the east. Ahead they
saw spread out before them the jungled garden of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the Pass, its green poles of saguarros standing silent
sentinels all about in the dawn and the gray mountains
hemming it in all around.</p>

<p>“Now, fellers, we cayn’t take them hosses promiscuous
up no mountains, an’ I ain’t goin’ to leave
old Blazie, nohow!” declared Big John as he halted
the train. “This white mustang’s about as easy to
hide here as a Saskatchewan swan! Thar’s shore
goin’ to be some perishin’ lil’ rodero when them
spiggoty gents arrives in our midst! Two of us
hev gotto stay with these hosses.”</p>

<p>To hide them somewhere was the first thought of
all. Big John’s puckered eyes searched the Pass
for cover. Up ahead the mountains closed in to a
narrow gap resembling a gunsight, a lone green
saguarro upstanding in the center like a front sight
in its V-notch. A small, bare rocky hillock to the
right of the notch rose opposite a similar low spur
terminating the range on their left. But down under
the flanks of both of them they marked the high
bushy green of mesquite.</p>

<p>“A feller <i>might</i> lay low in thar hoss an’ all,”
declared Big John, sizing it up.</p>

<p>Scotty did not answer. He was scanning the
mountain sides which towered above them, mile on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
mile, shaggy and gray and covered with pale green
desert growth to a high skyline above. Somewhere,
over beyond that ridge maybe, Sid was in camp with
the Apache. Either Hano or Ruler could lead him
up there. But a peculiar telepathic influence kept
whispering to him that all was not right with Sid,
that he needed him <i>now</i>, was in some sort of danger
or trouble. It might have been just his own imagination;
it might have been the subtle mental bond
between the two chums, but the impulse was there
and it led him to decide on climbing up at once.</p>

<p>“You take Niltci and the horses and go to the
notch, John. If the Mexicans come in that way you
can let them go by and then slip out through the
gap and ride around the end of these mountains
and join us. Meanwhile this Apache and I will
climb up straight over the range to their camp. I
have a hunch that it’s over that mountain somewhere.
Here’s where we last saw Sid.”</p>

<p>“Looks that way—’scusin’ that the Injun’d knife
ye as soon as he got you alone up thar! I ain’t
trustin’ no Injun. Crooked as a Mex. gambler’s
deck, they be!” swore Big John emphatically.</p>

<p>Hano listened and watched them pointing, uneasily.
He wasn’t at all sure about showing these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
people Red Mesa after all. He had been reasoning
over it silently as their party had ridden along. He
had a new plan, now, and it was this: Here were
four good horses. A number of Mexicanos, a dozen
at least, were coming here after these white men.
Well, then, would it not be the best service he could
do for his tribe to induce them to lead the Mexicanos
on a wild race out into the Tule Desert along the
fearful Camino del Diablo, there to lose them all
somewhere in the desert? He might die of thirst
himself in the attempt. That was nothing; the
peace and safety of his tribe was everything—any
scheme to lead them all away from Red Mesa!
These white men certainly could never survive that
desert!</p>

<p>He now grunted eagerly and began to speak
earnestly to Niltci in mixed sign language and
Apache. He pointed to the notch and made the sign
of four horsemen with his fingers straddled over his
left hand. He pointed to Blaze and made signs of
concealing him in some dense cover. Then he
pointed to the notch again and gave a pantomime of
their party galloping through it with other horsemen
in pursuit.</p>

<p>“I got ye, son!” grinned Big John. “We-all give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
’em a desert race, hey? A-1 idee!” he chuckled.
“Scotty, if I know human natur, that pisen spig,
that Vasquez”—Big John spat it out like a curse—“ain’t
told them guerrillas nothin’ about no mine.
Stolen church property’s what they think they’re
after. They’ll be considerable peeved, an’ will begin
shootin’ soon’s they sight us. Now if this Vasquez
starts gittin’ careless with his hardware—an’ I git
one good poke at him with the old meat gun—Sho!—there
won’t be nobody know <i>nothin’</i> about
that mine but us, see? Another thing: when he
climbs Cerro Colorado and don’t see no Red Mesa,
what does he do? Thinks he’s disremembered what
he read on that Dago tablet, sabe? He’ll think I’m
Sid, sabe, an’ he’ll chase us clar to Yuma, aimin’ to
get hold of it again. We don’t want him ’round
hyar, that’s sure! I’m strong fer the Apache’s
racin’ scheme. Hyar’s one big chance to lose him
good, savvy?”</p>

<p>“How about Sid?” objected Scotty.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right! Thick as thieves with these
Apaches, I’ll bet. He talks their lingo, you know.”</p>

<p>Still the feeling remained persistent in Scotty’s
mind that all was not right with Sid. Where <i>were</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
these Apaches, anyhow; and why had Hano not
taken them to their encampment at once?</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he exclaimed at length. “You leave
Ruler with me. Go on with Niltci and the Apache
and try your race stunt. Meanwhile I’ll slip away,
put Ruler on Sid’s track, and so find out where he’s
gone myself.”</p>

<p>“Not so good, son! Not so good!” approved Big
John whismically. “You sorter hang back, then,
an’ git away when you kin. Try along the base of
them mountains. I think Sid rode off that way
when he left us. You leave them greasers to us!
They won’t bother you none! C’mon, fellers, le’s
get movin’. We ain’t got <i>all</i> the time there is!”</p>

<p>Through Niltci he signified assent to Hano’s plan.
They started across the sands for the notch which
now lay in plain daylight before them glowing with
the colors of the rising sun. Gradually the three
ahead urged their ponies to a gallop, twisting and
turning through the patches of choyas and spiny
barrel cactus.</p>

<p>Scotty fell behind, Ruler on his leash loping along
beside him. As dense groves of mesquite barred
their path he let himself get separated from the
others and worked over toward the mountain base,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
keeping cover constantly between him and the party
ahead.</p>

<p>In five minutes Scotty was completely lost to them.
After a time he came upon lone pony tracks in the
sand. Beside them had trotted Blaze’s footprints.
Here was where Sid had gone toward the mountain.
Sheep hunting, no doubt, Scotty conjectured, for he
knew that Sid liked to hunt alone. Nearer and
nearer came the abrupt flanks of the mountains.
Steep and rugged, rising in towering masses, the
rocky flanks rolled up high above Scotty. Somewhere
up there Sid had climbed, he was sure.</p>

<p>Presently he came upon a game trail, winding
along in the sand around the rocky outcroppings.
Sheep tracks! Scotty rode on hurriedly now, the
hunting ardor rising within him. Presently he came
to a little patch of galleta grass, trampled down in a
ring around a picket pin, where a pony had fed. The
story was plain to Scotty. Sid’s pinto had been
tethered here and had broken away after a time,
probably because of thirst.</p>

<p>No; the Apache had <i>taken</i> him away, for here
were his moccasin prints! Here were Blaze’s, too,
coming from the mountains. It became more and
more a puzzle to Scotty. What had really happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
to Sid? It looked more than ever like treachery—foul
play—to Scotty. Somewhere up on the
mountain Sid had encountered the Apaches perhaps.
He had been held by them, since he had not returned.
But Hano had been here and had taken
his horse. What did it all mean?</p>

<p>For a time Scotty hesitated, thinking seriously of
riding after Big John to bring him and Niltci here
to get their judgment on this discovery. Then he
saw the firm heel print of Sid’s hunting boot leading
up the mountain side. The ardent impatience
of youth at once overwhelmed him. Follow, and at
once, he must!</p>

<p>He put Ruler’s moist nose to the print: “<i>Sssuey</i>,
Ruler!—Go get Sid!—<i>Sid!</i>” he hissed in the dog’s
ear.</p>

<p>Ruler whined eagerly. Then, snuffing the trail,
he climbed on upward, his bony rat tail swinging
in circles as occasional yelps of discovery came from
him. Scotty climbed after and was soon high in the
rocks on the mountain flank, with the green plain
of the Pass spread out far and wide below him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile Big John and the two Indians had
ridden on swiftly. The Pass narrowed and in ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
minutes more they were at the base of the two low
hills guarding the gap. Hano looked around him
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Where is the white boy?” he asked Niltci, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s back thar a-piece—he’s a slow rider,”
laughed Big John reassuringly. Hano regarded them
suspiciously a moment as Niltci translated. Then he
shrugged his shoulders, his keen eyes searching the
groves of mesquite and palo verde for signs of the
laggard. A bed was made for Blaze under the
shelter of a dense bunch of creosotes and he was
tied there with a pan of water handy. Then the
horses were tethered in hiding behind that growth
of mesquite under the rock base which they had
noted from down the Pass. Niltci and Big John
unlimbered their rifles and climbed to a vantage
point on the low rocky spur jutting out to the east
of the main range.</p>

<p>They were not many minutes too soon! Over
the waste of sand dunes to the north a small white
cavalcade was toiling slowly along toward them.
The guerrillas, about a dozen of them, they noted,
were riding two by two. They were clad in white,
with huge white sombreros on head and the shining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
bands of cartridge belts crossing their chests at a
slant. Over their backs jutted up the slender
muzzles of Mausers. Dandy black boots heavily
spurred in silver gleamed through the dust along
the flanks of their horses. At the head of the column
alongside the leader rode a man clad in a
striped serapé, and at sight of him Big John’s eyes
began to smoulder.</p>

<p>He pointed him out to Niltci. “Thar’s that Vasquez,
the pisen, ornery, li’l horned toad that’s makin’
all the trouble, Niltci!” he growled. “The mine ain’t
wuth shootin’ nobody fer, though. We’ll hev to
throw an all-fired scare into him with a leetle fancy
shootin’, sabe?”</p>

<p>Niltci grunted understanding and they both
watched the cavalcade approaching. As they entered
the Pass below, Hano’s wild eyes glared up at them.
Now was the time for his great sacrifice! In just
a little while longer these Mexicans would be through
the gap and nearing those mountains whose secret
he felt bound to protect. They must never be allowed
to remain here, to trace out those tell-tale
tracks! He looked up at Big John for the signal
to dash down to the ponies and begin that race that
could only end in the arid wastes of the Camino del<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Diablo. Once out there, they could shoot him with
those long-range rifles if they were able. But die
of thirst they all surely would! As for himself, he
trusted in his desert knowledge to survive until it
would be safe to return to Red Mesa.</p>

<p>But, alas for the best laid plans of mice and
men! Nature has a grim way of playing tricks that
upset our best schemes—cruel tricks, sometimes.
For, hardly had the Mexican riders gotten well
through the gap with yells of delight as they followed
the trail into that beautiful desert garden,
when, from up on the high mountain flanks behind
Big John’s position, came a sudden rolling of stones
bounding down the hill. The Mexicans all halted
and looked up, shouting to each other eagerly. Big
John looked around inquiringly, and Hano gazed
with an expression of anguish in his black eyes. Up
there ranged a band of mountain sheep! A large
band, seventeen in all, if any one had stopped to
count them. Rams, ewes and young ones, they were
all clattering along the summit of the ridge, outlined
clearly against the sky and headed for the fastnesses
of the higher slopes.</p>

<p>At sight of them eager cries came from all the
Mexicans. They began to dismount hurriedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Rifles were unslung, cartridges hastily torn from the
bandoliers. Then a wild race began up that mountain
after those doomed sheep.</p>

<p>Hano gave a grunt of dismay. That chase could
only lead to one thing—the immediate discovery of
Red Mesa, the hiding place of his tribe that lay beyond
those ridges!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

THE SUN DANCE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SID whirled swiftly, after Hano had gone.
The slight swaying of a medicine skin—the
pelt of an albino big-horn—told him
where the opening to the tunnel was. Lifting it
aside, a jagged hole in the lava showed, and from
below came up a faint tinge of sulphur smell. Sid
thought first of going down into the tunnel and hiding
in it somewhere, watching his chance to escape.
Then he decided against it. He ought to give Hano
all the time he could. That <i>both</i> of them had disappeared
would be immediately noticed in the village.
He looked around, thinking rapidly about
what to do next. A bundle of plumed prayer sticks
among the ritual appurtenances of the lodge caught
his eye and it gave him the idea he was searching
for. Going outside the lodge and closing its door,
he secured it with a prayer stick. That sign would
signify that the lodge was closed to all but medicine
men and would keep out any casual stroller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>It was now nearly sunset. Sid sought out
Honanta again but he was not at his lodge. Sounds
of busy life came from the grass huts. Fresh meat
of the ram was being prepared for an evening feast;
more of it was being hung on drying poles to cure
in the sun. A knot of young braves was playing the
hoop game, rolling the hoop swiftly along a path
and striving to pierce it with lances as it sped.</p>

<p>Sid watched them awhile, a feeling of melancholy
growing on him. These people were happy, free,
and independent. Under Honanta’s leadership they
were living life simply and nobly, as the early Indians
did. To match it, you had to go back two hundred
years to the time when religion was everything
in an Indian’s life, when warfare was an incentive
to chivalry similar to our own warfare of the middle
ages; when there were no white men to set one tribe
against another, to teach them to scalp one another
by offering a bounty for the hair of a fellow red man,
or to sell them whisky and weapons far more
deadly than any they naturally used.</p>

<p>Sid felt himself playing traitor to his best instincts
when he thought of what the coming of
Scotty and Big John would mean to these people.
Scotty had come to the Pinacate region to find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Red Mesa mine. Well he, Sid, had found it for
him! But he had not dreamed to find it also the
home of a happy and peaceful band of red men—that
race with which Sid was becoming more and
more in sympathy.</p>

<p>But now look what would happen! Scotty would
claim the mine, stake it out, ask him and Big John
to sign as witnesses, and then file the claim with the
government. And then, with the publishing of that
claim, would come the inevitable stampede to this
region. White men, hundreds of them; ships, rails,
ore cars, burros, rough and sweating white miners—a
rabble that would sweep Honanta and his people
away like chaff. It did Sid little good to tell
himself that he had sent Hano to bring his friends
so that they could defend Red Mesa against the
Mexicans. That would be a mere incident in the
march of progress. Vasquez and his guerrillas
would surely come here, riding along the border
from Nogales. They would find the pony tracks,
climb the mountain and discover Red Mesa. After
that, no doubt Vasquez would fight for it. But
even if defeated and driven off, there was Scotty
to be reckoned with, for his heart was set on this
mine, his whole future depended on it. That he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
would insist on providing for these Indians, of
course, would be his natural instincts for right and
justice. But he would insist, too, on the mine being
developed. Sid doubted whether it could be done,
in the nature of his race, without first bringing
about the destruction of these Apaches. Honanta
would never give this place up without a fight for
it against all comers.</p>

<p>Sid wished that his father could be here to counsel
him. He had almost a conviction that he was
really that officer who had saved Honanta’s life in
Apache Cave so long ago. It would be just like
him. That deed would give his father vast influence
over the chief, and some way out of this tangle
of perplexities would be found by the good old
Colonel. Sid wished now that he had sent Hano
direct to bring his father. The Colvin ranch was
up in the Gila Cañon on the railroad not a hundred
miles away. The name was already well known in
Arizona, their station near the ranch being named
“Colvin’s” on the main line. Hano could have
reached the rails by a fast push out to Tacna, and
then have taken the train to Colvin’s. That would
bring the Colonel here in two days at most, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
there was a railroad to Ajo Mines only fifty miles
away from Pinacate.</p>

<p>But it was too late now. After-thought is mere
aggravation! What would Hano really do, now
that he was free? Sid asked himself. He confessed
he didn’t know. We know nothing of the
Indian mind and its workings. We really know
nothing of the race nor where they came from. Not
Semitic, surely, for, Phœnician Jew or Arab, the
accumulation of vast stores of wealth is the dominant
Semitic trait, and the Indian scorns wealth and
miserliness alike.</p>

<p>Sid was convinced that they are of the same Aryan
stock as ourselves. If so, his theory was that they
must have migrated east from Asia at a far earlier
period than our own ancestors’ westward migration,
for we still have the Aryan word roots, while in
America there are no less than three great Indian
languages—Algonquin, Athapascan, Siouan—totally
different, the peoples also as different in physical
and moral characteristics as are our own Teutonic
and Latin branches of the same Aryan stock.</p>

<p>We developed individualism as we migrated westward.
The Indian developed it, too, in this great
new land, but he retained one distinctive Asiatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
trait—the impersonal ego—the sinking of self in the
clan whose interests are always paramount to everything
else.</p>

<p>Reasoning from that, Sid tried to conjecture
what Hano’s motives would be. To keep <i>all</i> these
whites, Mexicans and his own friends alike, away
from Red Mesa, the home of his clan; to kill Ruler,
the tracking dog, so that Sid could not be traced
here, seemed to Sid what Hano would really do. He
would act on that basis, Sid was sure. His own
chance of rescue, then, was really very slight. His
life was safe for twenty-four hours, no matter what
the old men might decide in council. After that his
fate really depended solely on the identity of his
name with that Colvin of Apache Cave! But how to
prove to Honanta that that man was Colonel Colvin
himself? To claim it without proof would be taken
by the Indians as a mere forlorn hope to save his
own life. Hano could have brought that proof for
him, given time enough; now it was too late. Sid
gave it all up; there was really nothing to do but
wait events.</p>

<p>The sun was setting as Sid finished his ruminations.
The water pool already lay in shadow, the
black bottom of its lava basin turning the deep blue-green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> 
of its waters to a mirror of shining black. A
sharp shadow line was creeping in horizontal masses
of dark maroon far up on the face of the east wall,
every broken fissure and pinnacle of the west wall
shadow etched on its high face. Sid kept one eye
nervously on the door of the medicine lodge, wondering
how it was all going to turn out. No one
had visited it yet, but discovery of Hano’s escape was
sure and would come soon.</p>

<p>As Sid waited and watched, Honanta came out of
a sweat lodge near the borders of the tank. He
was naked save for breech cloth and moccasins, and
slowly he walked to the brink of the lava basin
where it tumbled out between the high walls of Red
Mesa. Like some magnificent bronze statue he stood
for a time on the brink, facing the setting sun, his
arms outstretched in silent prayer. Then an old
man tottered out from the council lodge bearing a
ceremonial pipe. Honanta took it from him and,
after a few whiffs, held its bowl toward the setting
sun. Again he dipped it reverently toward Mother
Earth and the sunset ceremony was ended. Sid
noted that he did not add the modern symbolism of
offering the pipe to the four winds.</p>

<p>After him every brave in the tribe, down to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
little boys of eight, stood and did the same thing,
that act of reverence to the Earth and Sun, the most
important of the creations of the Great Mystery,
which ethnologists often stupidly report as sun worship,
earth worship. But Sid knew that, like their
nature worship, it was really reverencing the Great
Mystery through His creations. He had long ago
adopted that viewpoint as his own, and was about
to share in the ceremony himself, claiming the privilege
as an adopted Blackfoot, when a soft footfall
along the path drew his attention.</p>

<p>The girl Nahla was approaching the medicine
lodge! She bore food and water for her husband,
the prisoner. Sid felt tingles of excitement running
all through him as he rose and walked rapidly after
her.</p>

<p>“Nahla!” he called, as soon as they were far
enough away from the rest of the village to be alone.</p>

<p>The girl turned and faced him.</p>

<p>“Do not enter!” he said softly in Apache.</p>

<p>“Oh, have they killed him?” she almost shrieked.
“<i>Hai</i>—I hate you!” Like a fury she faced the bewildered
Sid. It was his first experience with
women—the instant feminine jumping to conclusions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
the fierce and unreasoning hate for the cause
of her sorrows.</p>

<p>“No. He lives; but do not enter the lodge, I beg
you. You must trust in me, Nahla!” said Sid
earnestly.</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders scornfully.
“Pah! And is my husband to go without food and
drink!” she spat out. With a lithe, sudden dash she
had reached the lodge door and put her hand on the
plumed prayer stick that held it shut.</p>

<p>Sid leaped after her. “No!” he barked. “Listen,
Nahla—Hano is gone! I freed him. I sent him.
They do not know, yet.”</p>

<p>The girl turned about, suspicion burning in her
black eyes. “<i>You?</i>” Rapidly anguish filled her
whole expression, then anger. “You made him run
away!” she accused. “You made him break his
honor—you, white man with a serpent’s tongue!”</p>

<p>With a swift movement she withdrew the prayer
stick and flung wide the door. Unmindful of Sid’s
expostulations she stood for a moment looking inside.
Then she turned and ran shrieking toward
the huts. “Hano! My Hano! He is gone! He
has broken his honor! The white man freed him!—Honanta!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
Honanta!” she cried, running along the
path.</p>

<p>Sid looked after her helplessly. Honanta was
stalking toward her as fast as his dignity would permit.
They stopped and exchanged a few words.
Sid braced himself for what was coming, hoping
that his wits would save him this time.</p>

<p>Honanta came up to him, his face a dark thundercloud,
angry lines seaming it. “What is this, white
boy?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I freed Hano, chief. I had a good reason for
it. You must trust me,” replied Sid, as stoutly as
he could in the face of that towering passion.</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Honanta, craftily, controlling himself.
“Why?” He was speaking in Apache now,
and so was Sid, the subterfuge that he did not understand
it being abandoned by both.</p>

<p>“You shall learn, soon, chief. I am acting for
the good of us all,” said Sid earnestly.</p>

<p>Honanta studied him awhile in silence. “My son,
because your name is Col-vin I have persuaded my
old men to spare your life. My heart tells me that
you may be the son of that officer who spared my
mother and me—whose name also was Colvin. In
freeing Hano I believe that you meant well. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
is dark to me why <i>my</i> son, Hano, consented to run
away! His honor required him to await the judgment
of my old men, even if not a thong bound him.”</p>

<p>“He, too, did it for the sake of the tribe,
Honanta,” declared Sid with profound conviction.</p>

<p>Honanta knitted his brows, puzzled. “My son,”
said he gently, “is not the truth best? No—you
do not lie!” he added hastily as a frown gathered in
Sid’s face, “but you know more than we do. I must
tell what you <i>do</i> know to my old men, for they are
very wise and their decision is final. You have told
me nothing that gray hairs can listen to, so far,” he
concluded persuasively.</p>

<p>Sid reflected. Would it not be better to tell the
whole truth <i>now</i> and trust in Honanta’s judgment?
He decided to tell part of it anyhow, for Big John
and Scotty might be led here by Ruler to-morrow,
he felt, and he might as well explain them now.</p>

<p>“I sent Hano to bring my friends here,” he replied.
“They have a tracking dog—a hound—and
could trace me here in any event, so I wanted to
avoid a fight. The dog would lead them to Red
Mesa, chief.”</p>

<p>“And so you sent Hano!” laughed Honanta.
“My son Hano would kill that dog, kill those friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
of yours, too, sooner than permit them to reach our
home! Did you not think of that?”</p>

<p>Sid attempted to show his surprise at this Indian
point of view on his action, but the idea was not new
to him and the chief saw it.</p>

<p>“Come! There is more back of it, yet, my son!”
prompted Honanta. “The truth—and I will do what
I can for you with the elders.”</p>

<p>“There’s a party of Mexicans coming along the
border,” replied Sid desperately. “They will find
our tracks and trace us all to this place. I felt that
we needed my friends to help you defend it,
Honanta. That’s the whole truth.”</p>

<p>“Ha!—No! There is more!” exclaimed Honanta,
his choler rising. “<i>Why</i> are the Mexicanos coming?
And why is your party down here? Do you think
I do not know why? Somehow, the tale of our
mine has gotten out! Don’t I know what white
men will do to possess themselves of a mine? What
<i>won’t</i> they do!” he exclaimed bitterly. “You are
all our enemies!”</p>

<p>“Not I!” retorted Sid, stoutly. “I am an ethnologist—no
miner! The study of your people is
my lifework, chief. Sympathy for them has become
my ruling passion. Since I came here, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
one idea has been to preserve this place forever as
your home. I’ll seal my friend’s lips forever about
this mine——”</p>

<p>Sid stopped hastily, for he had made a slip that
he had not intended. It did not escape Honanta,
however.</p>

<p>“No! <i>we</i> shall do that!” he said grimly. “My
son, you are an enemy to us. You cannot help yourself.
But, because of him who saved my mother
and you who represent him, I have vowed to give a
Sun Dance to-morrow. You must be present at it,
for you are the physical evidence of my deliverer.
According to our laws of hospitality you have one
sun of immunity among us. But to-morrow, when
his shadow reaches <i>there</i>,” the Chief pointed to a
great crack on the inside of the west wall—“you
must go forth—if you can.... As for your
friends, we shall take care of them if Hano does
not!”</p>

<p>He turned and motioned to two of his braves.
“Bind him!” he commanded. “Medicine lodge!”</p>

<p>They stepped forward and seized Sid. In a very
few minutes he found himself seated, firmly bound
to the very post from which he had freed Hano but
recently. The food Nahla had brought for Hano<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
was fed him; then the door was shut and he was left
in the darkness of the lodge.</p>

<p>Sid reflected over it all as he sat, awaiting the
long vigil until morning. Escape was impossible.
Not only was he bound cunningly to the post so that
any movement of even his hands was impossible,
but two Apache guards squatted near him, silent
as specters but watching him fixedly.</p>

<p>“Go forth—if you can!” had been Honanta’s last
words. In them Sid found his sole hope. Honanta
was still his friend, but the logic of the situation
had been too strong even for him. But Honanta
was more than his friend. It was true, then, that
Colonel Colvin was that white officer! Honanta had
said so at last. Through his father he owed a debt
that to an Indian is never paid. Honanta, too, was
torn between two duties—that to his tribe and that
to Sid as the Colonel’s son. In the subtle workings
of the Indian mind there would surely be a loophole
for him, somewhere, by Honanta, Sid felt. It
was for him to find and utilize that loophole of escape.
It would be something that would clear
Honanta’s conscience as regards his tribe, yet fulfill
his obligation to him as the son of the man who
had saved his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>What it would be, Sid could not imagine. He
decided to keep his eyes open to-morrow, alert to
seize the opportunity whatever it should be. Then,
with the ability of youth to sleep anywhere and in
any impossible posture, his head fell forward on his
chest and he was soon oblivious of his and any one
else’s troubles.</p>

<p>Next morning as he was led from the lodge, a
notable change in the village greeted him. A high
Sun Dance pole had been erected during the night,
with a cross bar secured near its top. From the
bar dangled two effigies; the figure of a man and
of a mountain sheep. Sid recognized the symbol of
it. The figure represented Honanta, dead but for
the intervention of the Great Mystery in the person
of that white officer who had spared his mother.
The mountain sheep represented man’s physical life,
his principal means of sustenance, the gift of
Mother Earth, replacing the buffalo of plains ceremonies.</p>

<p>After a time Honanta appeared, nude save for his
moccasins and breech clout; his hair was disheveled,
his body daubed with clay. He dragged after him
the skull of a mountain sheep, symbolizing the grave
from which he had escaped by divine intervention.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
As the eastern sun flamed over the wall of Red
Mesa, an old priest cut and scarified Honanta’s
chest, signifying the natural accompaniments of a
physical death.</p>

<p>The rest of the tribe now formed in a line under
the east wall and faced him. Sid himself was
placed opposite Honanta, standing alone. He felt
awed at the part he was taking—for he obviously
represented the instrument through which the Great
Mystery had shown His favor.</p>

<p>Looking with fixed eyes on the sun, Honanta
began the Sun Dance, dragging the skull after him
and blowing from time to time on a sacred whistle
which he kept pointed at the sun as it rose toward
the zenith.</p>

<p>Sid watched him, fascinated. He was seeing the
original Sun Dance, the Indian symbol of death and
resurrection, as it was before later changes degraded
it into a meaningless exhibition of endurance under
torture—about on the level with our own bull-ring
and prize-fight arena. How long the dance would
keep up depended solely upon Honanta’s physical endurance.
He was not much over forty years of age,
so he would be yet in his prime, and his fervor would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
lead him to dance before the Great Mystery until
his sinews could work no longer.</p>

<p>Sid’s prayers went out to aid him. He liked to
see a man give his best! This humbling of the body
was nothing repulsive, when one thought of the exalted
mood of that soul, engaged in an act of Indian
worship so far above our own milder and, let us say,
more self-indulgent and vanity-ridden forms of
ritual.</p>

<p>An hour passed; two hours, while still the devoted
Honanta maintained the peculiar syncopated rhythmic
dance of the Indian. Occasionally his voice rose
in a wild, high chant, relating the story of his rescue
by that white officer of long ago. He called on
the soul of his mother to witness; poured out prayers
in thankful chants to the Great Mystery.</p>

<p>Sid watched, himself entirely in sympathy, the
whole band of Apaches gradually working themselves
to higher and higher exaltation of religious
feeling. He hardly noted the passage of time until
a glance over to the west wall brought home to him
with a sudden shock that the shadow of the east
wall had nearly reached that crack in the granite.
His time was coming soon!</p>

<p>Others had noticed it, too, for one of the elders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
spoke a word. With a final invocation to the Great
Mystery, Honanta slowly brought his dance to a
close. He tottered toward Sid, his eyes sightless,
his hand groping until it gripped Sid’s.</p>

<p>Sid felt a renewed fervor in that grip, but all
Honanta said was: “My son, guide me—for you
must now go forth from us.”</p>

<p>One of the braves pressed Sid’s rifle into his
hands. Leading Honanta, Sid started for the medicine
lodge. Young bucks and elders surrounded
them. They were fully armed and their faces expressed
the grim determination of the executioner.
Sid guided Honanta to the outlet of the tunnel and
himself raised the medicine sheepskin.</p>

<p>“Careful, my father!” he warned courteously,
putting Honanta’s hands on the ladder post.</p>

<p>They descended, the tunnel filled with creeping
warriors, ahead and behind them. Sid could not
see what chance there was for his life in this! To
whirl and shoot the instant his foot left the cave?—before
he could move, a flight of arrows would
feather themselves in him! If Honanta had a loophole
in mind it must be provided soon!</p>

<p>But the party crept on down steadily. Then
along each side of the cave entrance the bucks parted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
and lined up with arrow on string. Sid drew a
long breath and stepped steadily to the entrance. Beyond
that he could not go, without death. Bows
creaked as he turned slowly, to find arrows drawn
to the head upon him.</p>

<p>But Honanta was close behind him. “You must
go forth, now, my son,” he pronounced gravely.</p>

<p>Sid tensed every muscle in his body, intending to
throw himself down the lava crevice and then turn
and shoot for his life. It was a forlorn hope,
but——</p>

<p>Two long, fringed, buckskinned arms closed
slowly around him as his foot lifted for the first
step. Sid halted wonderingly—but the push of
Honanta urged him on:</p>

<p>“Go forth, my son—<i>and I will go with thee</i>!”
whispered the chief’s voice in his ear. “I cannot
see thee slain! Let them shoot!”</p>

<p>Honanta’s own arms were around him now, his
body protectingly between him and the Apaches.
<i>That</i> was the way he had solved his dilemma!</p>

<p>Sid backed rebelliously. “No, chief! No! You
must not!” he protested, attempting to turn in the
chief’s arms. The utter silence of astonishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
was all around them, the Apaches hesitating, arrow
on bow, utterly disconcerted at this sudden development.</p>

<p>“On! While there is time!” grated the chief’s
voice. “We shall escape to your people. They
must never find Red Mesa. I trust you, my son,
to keep silence!” urged Honanta.</p>

<p>Sid nodded. Honanta had found the best way
out of it all. They were about to go on, letting
the tribe decide as it would, when the distant
<i>Rrrraammp! Rrrraammp! Rrrraammp!</i> of rifle shots
coming from over the mountain arrested them.</p>

<p>“Halt! It is too late, Honanta!” barked Sid.
“Listen!”</p>

<p>A fusillade of distant rifle shots broke out; then
the rapid, continuous discharge of a repeating rifle.</p>

<p>“Ten shots!” said Sid. “That’s the Navaho’s
Winchester, chief. Ours hold only five. Those
other shots are <i>Mausers</i>—not hunting rifles! The
Mexicans are here!”</p>

<p>He pushed Honanta back in the cave and then
faced the Apaches. “Warriors of the Apache, I
must stay and fight with you!” his voice rang out.
“Those rifles are of Mexicanos, coming to take your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
home. After it is all over you can do what you will
with me. Is it peace?”</p>

<p>The Apaches nodded sullenly and lowered their
bows. Without Honanta they were leaderless.</p>

<p>“Let no one go out!” ordered Sid. “We need
every man right here!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

THE DEFENSE OF RED MESA</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the Mexican rifles whipped and sang in
the crags sheep after sheep staggered and
fell. Hano’s eyes blazed with indignation.
At least six of these white-clad Mexicanos were up
there and three of the sheep were killed, a noble
ram and two ewes, but still the slaughter went on
unceasingly. That band of big horns and a few
others like it around Pinacate were almost the sole
meat supply of Hano’s tribe. A few each year had
been plenty to keep them all in meat. <i>One</i> ram
would have been more than enough to feed all this
band of white men all they could carry away, yet
nothing less than the slaughter of them all—brutal,
thoughtless, insensate killing for the mere pleasure
of shooting seemed their purpose. Higher and
higher the Mexican hunters climbed, following the
doomed sheep up to the ridges. Once over them
and——</p>

<p>With a great bitter cry of rage at the sickening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
insatiate greed of it, Hano rose to his feet, snatched
Niltci’s rifle from his hands and emptied it in rapid
shots. He sent bullets whistling among the hunters
up in the crags, then shot down horses among that
group closely packed in the Pass below them. Dashing
down the empty weapon with a curse of rage, he
bounded down through the mesquite and was lost
to sight. Niltci, himself overwhelmed with indignant
sympathy over this useless slaughter of wild
life, had not interfered with Hano and he now
picked up the rifle and reloaded it.</p>

<p>“Good hunch, Injun! Shootin’ them hosses is
our best bet arter all!” muttered Big John to himself
raising the meat gun to his shoulder. He aimed
full at the serapé-clad rider who sat his horse, yelling
up at the hunters above and signaling urgently to
them to return.</p>

<p>“Greaser, I could kill you now, an’ end all this to
onct,” he muttered, “but ontil you shoots at me fust,
I cayn’t do it.” He lowered the sights a trifle and
pulled trigger. Instantly the horse which the Mexican
rode collapsed and fell kicking on the sands.
Vasquez jumped free.</p>

<p>“<i>Gringoes! Enemigos! Tira! Tira!</i>” he yelled,
shaking his fists and pointing wildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Big John went on shooting, picking off horse after
horse. Niltci’s rifle was thundering in his ears,
for the indignant Navaho had turned <i>his</i> fire on the
sheep slaughterers now scrambling madly down the
hill. A wild commotion had broken out in the confused
knot of horses and men that were left of the
cavalcade. Presently a band of five of them mounted
and rode swiftly toward their position. Then down
below a single war whoop rang out and Big John saw
a lone Indian rider dash out into the Pass. It was
Hano, making his sacrifice of leading as many as
possible of the enemy after him away into the desert.
A fusillade of shots greeted him; then the rapid
clatter of hoofs as the whole band swept by, Hano
far in the lead on Sid’s pony. Big John dropped
the foremost horse as they passed below him; the
rest swept by quirting their mounts furiously as
Hano disappeared over a swale in the sand dunes.</p>

<p>“Now we got to settle with Mister Vasquez!”
exclaimed Big John grimly. “Thar’s still half a
dozen of them with him, against the two of us up
yonder.”</p>

<p>But Niltci did not hear for he had crept up to a
better position. He had seen nothing of Hano’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
race as he was too hotly engaged with the Mexicans
on the hillside.</p>

<p>Big John peered out of his rocky lair, looking for
“that ornery Vasquez.” A glimpse of him showed
high among the rocks; then his rifle barked and the
bullet spanged the rocks near by. The other Mexicans
were now well concealed in the crags and the
crack of their rifles and the whine and smash of
Mausers about Big John’s position told him that
the battle was on in dead earnest. For a time the
fight remained stationary, both sides so well concealed
that no quickness of sight could register a
direct hit. Then a shot rang out, much nearer to
the left.</p>

<p>“Bad business, Niltci,” called out Big John,
“they’re working down this way an’ hev got us cornered
on this little knoll. We gotto do a sneak
around this point and git above them somehow.”</p>

<p>Niltci had already foreseen the danger, for he was
now creeping snakelike through the rocks around the
right flank of the knoll.</p>

<p>Big John grunted whimsically as he followed
after: “Gosh dern it, I ain’t even goin’ to <i>act</i>
civilized, pronto, if these hyar doin’s keeps up! I
don’t like that party in the barber-pole poncho, none,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
an’ I’ll get careless and drill daylight through him
ef I don’t watch myself!” he soliloquized.</p>

<p>Then he came out on the right flank of the knoll,
where all that vast interior angle of the mountain
range burst at once into full view. For a moment
he peered out and just stared! A huge black apron
of lava fell out of the high lap of the mountains
and spread far and wide down the slope until lost
in the sands. But, dominating the gap where this
lava flowed out, he saw two immense red walls, cast
up like opening trap doors of granite. From his
position the whole formation could be grasped in its
entirety and its resemblance to a mesa struck Big
John at once.</p>

<p>“She looks jest like Thunder Mountain up near
Zuñi to me,” he muttered wonderingly, “only she’s
red. <i>Red Mesa</i>, by gum!” he exploded, as the conviction
smote upon him. “An’ that pesky Sid’s been
and gone an’ found it! Thar’s whar he is, now,
with them Apaches, I’ll bet my hoss! Wouldn’t
that knock ye dead?”</p>

<p>Silent, majestic, imposing, Red Mesa shimmered
in the morning sun, high above all. That it held the
secret of Sid’s disappearance and explained the mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
of these Apaches was a conclusion that Big
John jumped to instinctively.</p>

<p>And then a shrill squall of triumph rang out high
on the mountain side above him! Big John crawled
to a better outlook and gazed upward. Exposed on
a ragged pinnacle, Vasquez stood waving a rifle
triumphantly over his head and screaming in Spanish
unintelligibly. That he had seen Red Mesa, too, and
was calling to himself all his guerrillas there was
no doubt at all!</p>

<p>Big John raised his rifle carefully, its tall front
sight rising high above the rear bar. “Four hundred,
five hundred; no, more’n six hundred yards!”
he muttered. “It’ll be some stretch for the ole meat
gun, but, greaser, you’ve looked at this parteekler
scenery all you’re entitled to!”</p>

<p>He held the bead steady, resting his elbow on a
rock. Gradually his muscles cramped in a rigid
pose while the tiny dot up there in the crags hovered
motionless over the tip of his front sight.</p>

<p>“Sho! greaser,” said Big John, lowering the rifle.
“Y’ain’t done nawthin’ yit what I orter kill ye fer!
Yore int’rested, jist now—it’s our chanct to make a
run for it an’ git between you an’ th’ home plate, I’m
thinkin’. Siddy boy, I aims to reach ye this trip!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>He crept rapidly down to where Niltci lay concealed
and touched him on the shoulder. Together
they wormed swiftly down the mountain and reached
the sands. Here the high flanks concealed them from
the view of those above. After one sharp glance
around by Niltci, both ran at full speed along the
base. Up and up at a gentle slant for some half a
mile the sand drift led them, until they had arrived
at the foot of the lava flow where it dipped down below
the sands. Along its vitrified surface they sped—and
then Big John stopped and gripped Niltci’s
arm, breathing heavily. Above them on the lava
slope an apparition had appeared. A man crouched
in a sort of cave mouth up there, and he bore a rifle
in his hands. He waved energetically to Big John
to get under cover at once.</p>

<p>“Ef that ain’t Sid you can call me a tin-horn
gent!” gasped Big John. “<i>Whoopee, Sid!</i> Keep
down!—<i>Look out</i>, watch yourself!” he yelled out
alarmedly.</p>

<p>His outcry was fatal. A rifle whanged out up in
the cliffs above and instantly came the sharp thud of
a bullet. Big John coughed, groaned in the inflectionless
cry of the unconscious, and tumbled in a
heap on the rocks. Niltci gave one swift glance upward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
at the man in the serapé who had fired, then
grabbed Big John and dragged his huge shape under
the shelter of a crag. Sid had disappeared as if
struck flat, but the whip of his army carbine rang
out sharply. A volley of shots replied, coming from
all over the hillside. Bullets struck the lava apron
and went whining off into space; more of them
plunged down around Niltci’s position.</p>

<p>Bits of granite flew in a sharp dust about him.
The place was utterly untenable. Niltci looked for
a better lair, noted a little hollow in the crags and
then jumped out and exposed himself to draw their
fire for an instant. He heard shot after shot whipping
out from where Sid lay, felt the terrific smash
of Mausers all around him, then he picked up Big
John and raced with him for cover. A sharp touch
seared his arm. He felt it grow paralyzed in spite
of him and it let the cowman drop violently against
the rough scoriated boulders. A groan came from
Big John, showing that he still lived, then the
Navaho flung himself into the lair and rolled the
great limp body in after him.</p>

<p>But this could not last! It was as hot a corner
as man ever got into. Sooner or later flankers from
the guerrillas above would find a position from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
which it could be fired into, and then nothing could
save them. Niltci raised his voice in a low Navaho’s
death chant, watching the rocks above him from a
crevice in his lair, rifle poised for instant use. He
needed help badly. Finally he sent out the word
for it in a ringing call that would be understood by
the Apaches, if any were near. It would be upon
their honor to respond.</p>

<p>An occasional desultory shot now came from Sid,
up there on the lava apron. Above on the mountain
was silence, sinister, and foreboding. The Mexicans
were creeping carefully, silently downward toward
him. Presently there would be a rush of overwhelming
numbers—then death!</p>

<p>Niltci waited, finger on trigger, eyes alert. A
slight sound and the rolling of a stone came from
somewhere above, but he could see nothing without
exposing himself to he knew not what danger. It
had been Big John who had rescued <i>him</i> from his
own kinsmen, during those fanatical disturbances
caused by the Black Panther of the Navaho, and
Niltci would never desert him now! Coolly, resignedly,
he awaited that final rush that would be the
end of them both.</p>

<p>A rapid movement and the flinging of a body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
down behind some rocks sounded above him, right
close now. Sid’s rifle sang out but its bullet was
too late. Relentlessly they were closing in!</p>

<p>A low groan sounded below Niltci. He glanced
back out of the corner of his eye and saw that Big
John’s eyes were open. His face was livid, drawn
and gray, but he was turning feebly on his side and
fumbling at the big revolver strapped to his thigh.</p>

<p>“Watch yoreself—Injun—I’m gyardin’—yore
rear,” muttered the cowman hoarsely.</p>

<p>Niltci felt better. Big John was alive and could
shoot, anyhow! He moved to a new position where
he could command more of the rocks above. White-clad
figures dodged instantly out of sight behind
rocks as he appeared. They were all quite near him,
not over forty yards off. All that was needed was
some signal to precipitate a concerted rush. Niltci
looked about him for help again. Only the silent
lava wall and the surety that Sid was on watch up
there gave him any hope at all. Well, it would soon
come! All he hoped for was the chance of a few
shots from the repeater before one of these buzzing
Mauser bullets brought final oblivion.</p>

<p>And then, far above on the mountain side, sounded
the rapid belling of a hound!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span><i>Ruler!</i> Scotty was coming, and he would take
them <i>all</i> in the rear! Niltci fingered his trigger
eagerly as the musical notes floated nearer and
nearer: “Come, white boy! Come!” he sang, in
urgent Navaho chanting.</p>

<p>A heavy repeating rifle opened up, its familiar
cannonlike roars sounding sweet in the Indian lad’s
ears. That .405 could outrange anything on the
mountain, and Scotty was a dead shot!</p>

<p>Yells and cries broke out all around him above.
Men rose bewildered while Niltci emptied his repeater
and Sid’s rifle spoke rapidly, shot after shot
from the lava. The guerrillas were breaking, running.
Like snakes they were creeping off to new
points, out of reach of that heavy .405 whose bullets
split the granite where they struck!</p>

<p>Niltci felt that the psychological moment for attack
had come. This whole movement was bearing
off to the left now, the only place where the guerrillas
could be safe from fire above and below. He
leaped forward, darting from cover to cover and
firing at every sight of a white figure among the
rocks. Behind him he heard ringing Apache war
whoops, and, looking back, saw the whole lava slope
covered with buckskin-clad figures that had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
from he knew not where. In a moment more his
own mountain flank had swallowed them all up.
Niltci gave a single answering cry and pressed on.</p>

<p>Then he stopped, his heart stricken dead with
sudden alarm, for a whirl of objurgations in Spanish
raged below him and he saw a serapé-clad figure
racing along under the crags of the base, headed
straight for where Big John lay concealed! Niltci
turned and flung himself down the mountain, exposing
himself recklessly. To get to the wounded
Big John before this demon could finish him—ah,
might the Great Mystery lend him wings! In three
leaps he had reached the rocks above the lair. He
jumped out, rifle at shoulder, unmindful of anything
but not to be too late. Niltci got one glimpse of
Vasquez, standing with rifle poised, his eyes glaring
with surprise, for instead of Sid—the boy with the
Red Mesa plaque—Big John lay facing him, lying
on his side, cool resolution shining steadfastly in
his eyes, the big revolver poised in a hand that nevertheless
shook with weakness.</p>

<p>But before either of them could pull trigger a war
bow twanged resonantly and the swift flash of an
arrow swept across Niltci’s face. He saw Vasquez
tottering, faltering, and crumpling slackly; heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
rifle and the revolver bellow out together—and then
a tall Apache chief stood before him, breathing laboredly,
his eyes flashing the wild fire of war. Niltci
held his ground and his rifle half raised. Peace or
war with this chief, the Navaho boy faced him undaunted
and Niltci was going to defend that place
to the last! Below him was the little rocky lair where
lay Big John, silent, face downward.</p>

<p>The Apache raised his hand in the peace sign.
“Navaho, thou art a brave man! He that risks his
life for a friend!” he dropped his arm significantly
as if to say that no higher test of character existed.
“Come; my young men pursue them, and none shall
escape. Let us take this white man where his wounds
can be cared for, my brother.”</p>

<p>Just at that instant Sid came around the rocks
about the lava lair. For a moment he stood looking,
first at Big John lying silent as death, then at Niltci
sitting dazedly and weak on the ground. His eyes
glanced only once at the huddled figure of Vasquez.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!—Big John! Is he dead!” he cried, the
sudden catch of a sob in his voice.</p>

<p>He went over quickly to Big John and felt under
his shirt. Then he looked up, worried, anxious, but
hope shone in his eyes. “He’s alive, Chief! But we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
must act quickly, for he’s losing blood fast. Help
me, Honanta,” cried Sid urgently.</p>

<p>Together they got at the wound. That Mauser
had plunged downward, smashing through the shoulder
at a slant; tipped a lung, as the red froth on
Big John’s lips showed, and had come out in a
jagged tear below the big muscle on his chest. He
breathed laboredly and his eyes were still closed.
Sid shook his head and there were tears in his own
eyes. To lose Big John, that faithful, devoted old
friend who had raised him and Scotty from cubdom,
had been with them on a dozen expeditions, a thousand
hunts—it was unbelievable!</p>

<p>“I’ve seen worse. My medicine men can cure
him!” said Honanta cheerily. “We shall bring him
to our village, and all will be well. My son, your
friends are <i>our</i> friends! They have done well!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Honanta,” said Sid, simply. “I have
yet one more thing to ask you to do, and then this
whole business will come out all right.”</p>

<p>“And that is?” asked the chief, smiling.</p>

<p>“To come with me and meet my father,” said Sid
earnestly.</p>

<p>“<i>Ai!</i>—I shall go with you soon! But first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
where is my son, Hano? Not yet have I heard his
war cry,” replied Honanta anxiously.</p>

<p>Niltci turned from his guard of the place and
approached the chief. “He came to us, Apache. He
led us to these mountains. Then came the Mexicanos.
We were to run them a race away into the
desert with our fast horses. But they saw sheep
on the mountain. They started killing them—ugh,
but it was a slaughter sickening to see! More than
many, many white men could eat, they shot! Then
rose up your son, Hano, out of ambush and cursed
them, as I too would have done. He fired my rifle
at them, killing many horses. When the shells were
all gone he left us. That is all I know.”</p>

<p>“Who <i>does</i> know what became of Hano, then,
Niltci?” inquired Sid eagerly.</p>

<p>The Navaho pointed to the silent figure of Big
John.</p>

<p>“Hai!” breathed Honanta’s deep voice. “He <i>must</i>
live! I <i>must</i> know what has happened to my son!
If he died, it was as a great chief should die, for
his people. If he lives, this white man shall tell us
and my best trackers shall seek for him. Come!”</p>

<p>They all picked up the inanimate form of Big
John and carried him slowly along the lava apron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
brink. From afar came the occasional crack of a
rifle. The chase had gone a long distance to the
westward. Once they heard the bellow of Scotty’s
.405 from far down beyond the knoll. The peculiar
volume of it was unmistakable, easily told from the
sharper whip of the Mausers. Sid would have liked
to join him, but his duty now was to see Big John
under competent care. He had great faith in those
Apache medicine bundles. There were healing herbs
in them that the Indians alone knew; not all their
“medicine” was sorcery and meaningless medicine
dances, for in the treatment of wounds they were
wonderful.</p>

<p>Up the steep ascent and through the sulphur-fumed
reaches of the cave tunnel they bore Big
John. When he had been laid on a couch in the
medicine lodge and the old men had set to work at
his wounds, Sid called Niltci to him.</p>

<p>“I want to show you this Red Mesa, Niltci,” he
said, “for my heart is heavy within me. We can
do no further good here.”</p>

<p>Together they went out into the little valley,
Niltci’s cries of pleasure over its isolation and peace
as detail after detail of it was grasped by his keen
Indian mind singing in Sid’s ears. It made him even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
more depressed. What would Scotty’s reaction to
all this be? Scotty, the practical, hard-headed engineer,
who would no doubt hop on this mine with a
howl of delight and pooh-pooh any suggestion of
abandoning it to the Apaches as their home. The
first white man who staked out a claim here owned
it. These Indians <i>had</i> no rights. How could he
reconcile Gold with Nature in Scotty’s mind—dissuade
him from taking his civic rights, for the sake
of this people?</p>

<p>Sid wanted to have his mind made up before they
set out to join Scotty. He watched Niltci as they
came opposite the mine fissure. The Navaho boy
stopped with another exclamation of pleasure. He
was an expert silversmith himself, and he recognized
the metal instantly amid the dull copper. But in
Niltci’s eyes there showed no hint of possessing it,
of taking this whole mine for himself. This metal
was for all, the gift of Mother Earth to the whole
tribe, according to his training. He would be just
as welcome to set up his forge here and smelt all
the silver he wanted as the Apaches were to make
arrow tips of the copper. He told Sid this artless
viewpoint as the latter questioned him, seeking light
in his perplexity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>Sid shook his head. How different from Scotty’s
idea! A claim that gave exclusive ownership; vast
engineering works; ships; an organization that
would take <i>all</i> this metal for <i>one</i> man’s enrichment—that
was the white man’s way!</p>

<p>“Come, we must go find Scotty, Niltci,” said Sid
despondently, leading him away.</p>

<p>Honanta bid them good-by, assuring them that
Big John was doing well. Sid went down the cave
tunnel feeling like a traitor. His worst problem was
still ahead of him, he thought.</p>

<p>But the Great Mystery had planned otherwise, in
His inscrutable ways. For, when they reached the
lair where Big John had fallen, Vasquez was gone!
Honanta’s arrow had <i>not</i> killed him; he had been
simply feigning death while they were working over
Big John!</p>

GOLD VERSUS NATURE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“HOW goes it, Big John?” asked Sid
cheerily, coming into the medicine
lodge the morning after the big fight.</p>

<p>“Bad breath, worse feet—I’m mostly carrion, I
reckon,” smiled Big John weakly from his bandages.
“All-same turkey-buzzard.”</p>

<p>Sid laughed gayly. There was no quenching the
giant Montanian’s humor so long as the breath of
life existed in him! “Guess you’re better, all right!”
he answered, relieved.</p>

<p>“Whar’s my dear friend, Mister Spigotty?” inquired
Big John with elaborate sarcasm. “Last I
seen of <i>him</i>, he was fixin’ to turn loose a machine-gun
onto me.”</p>

<p>“We’re still worrying about him, John,” replied
Sid seriously. “He got away. The chief’s arrow
took him just as he was about to pull trigger on
you, but I think that loose serapé he wore saved him.
An arrow just loses its punch in it. Anyway, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
was only playing ’possum while we were fixing you
up, thinking he was done for. We haven’t seen the
last of him by a long shot. Ever hear the fate of
the Enchanted Mesa, John? That’s what’s worrying
me now.”</p>

<p>“Yaas,” said Big John, slowly. “Earthquake
shook down the trail up to her, didn’t it? Then the
hull tribe up thar jest nat’rally starved to death.”</p>

<p>“That’s what the ethnologists proved when they
finally got up on Enchanted Mesa,” agreed Sid.
“The Indian legend persisted that a tribe had once
been marooned up on that sheer-walled stronghold.
No one believed it was more than a legend until the
mesa was visited by an aeroplane or something and
then they found the ruins of an old pueblo. Did you
ever think, John, that this cave of ours is the <i>only</i>
gate to Red Mesa? If Vasquez blows <i>that</i> up with
dynamite we’re all doomed to starve here—another
Enchanted Mesa!”</p>

<p>“Yaas,” sighed Big John, wearily. “But Vasquez
shuts hisself out’n his own mine, that way,
though. An’ whar’s yore dynamite?”</p>

<p>“He’ll have some. Sure about that,” said Sid,
confidently. “A man doesn’t go mining without it
nowadays. And then, here’s the dickens of it: he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
can’t do anything about this mine with us around,
see? But, if he can shut us up here, all he’s got to
do then is to hang around—and let Nature do the
rest! We’ll all starve. See? Diabolical idea, eh?
But that’s the cold, cruel, Spanish logic of it, see?”</p>

<p>“Nice hombre!” growled Big John. “Take me
out thar, boys, whar I kin see thet cave mouth, and
lay the old meat gun beside me—he won’t do no sech
thing.”</p>

<p>“You lie still!” Sid soothed him. “Honanta
knows about it. He’s got scouts outlying all around
the cave mouth.”</p>

<p>“Take me out thar!” insisted Big John. “I ain’t
trustin’ no Injuns whar you boys is concerned!
Hyar! Put me under a brush shade at the top of
that lava dam, whar I can see the cave mouth.
’Twill do me good and give me a job of work!” he
urged.</p>

<p>Sid quieted him. “You couldn’t even lift a six-gun,
now, old settler! Lie still. Just as soon as
you can be moved we’ll set you out there, if it will
ease your mind.”</p>

<p>Big John sank back, satisfied, as most sick men
are, with a promise. After a time he raised his
head again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“Whar’s Scotty, Sid?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Sid, shortly. He shrugged
his shoulders and remained silent, his eyes averted.</p>

<p>Big John regarded him keenly for some time.
“You boys been quarrelin’, without yore old unkel
to go settin’ in the game?” he asked, trenchantly.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see it’s this way,” broke out Sid impulsively.
“Scotty’s all for staking out this mine
and filing a government claim on it. I couldn’t get
him to see it my way, so we—well, we had a row
over it,” said Sid. His voice told Big John how
it hurt him to have anything come up between himself
and such an old chum as Scotty.</p>

<p>“What’s yore idee, son?” asked Big John curiously.</p>

<p>“Haven’t these Indians any rights?” burst out
Sid impetuously. “Whose mine is it if not theirs?
It’s common property with them, though, just as are
the beans they raise and the game they shoot. Along
comes Scotty and thinks because he’s a white man
he has a right to stake a claim and take the whole
thing for himself. And our government will give
it to him, too—that’s the pity of it! Did <i>he</i> find
it? I guess not! And it’s their home, too! Are
we going to turn them out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>The fire in Sid’s voice told Big John how hot had
been that argument between the friends. All this
was, no doubt, Sid’s side of it.</p>

<p>“If Honanta knew what Scotty was really set on
doing not one of us would leave here alive,” went
on Sid, bitterly. “I’ve a good mind to tell him!
Anything, sooner than be a party to rank treachery
like that!”</p>

<p>“Scotty’s mother’s pretty hard up, ain’t she,
Sid?” asked Big John softly.</p>

<p>“Ye-es; a little discomfort, maybe, until he can
land a good job. But for that he’s going to turn
this whole tribe out, to wander at the mercy of our
government—and you know what that is!”</p>

<p>“Sho! The mine’d pay enough to buy them a
reservation big enough to support them all in the
style in which they is accustomed to!” laughed Big
John, weakly, “nawthin’ to it, son.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Scotty says,” replied Sid. “Some
day it will pay enough, maybe—if the promoters
don’t skin him out of all his rights in the mine first.
But meanwhile, what about these Indians and those
white miners who will surely come here? Whisky,
debauchery of their women, degradation of their
young men—isn’t it always the story when our two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
races come together? How can you prevent it?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>Big John shook his head. It was all too perplexing
to him, in his present weakened state.</p>

<p>“Think of it, John!” went on Sid, raptly. “A tribe
of Indians that has found peace at last! And now
that they think they have nothing that the white
man wants, along comes one of my race—and my
own best friend at that—and he wants the silver
and copper on their place! What’s the answer?—Move
on! It’s always that! I told him I’d borrow
money from my father for him, work for him all
my life, if he’d only let this go and keep silent about
Red Mesa forever.”</p>

<p>“An’ what’d Scotty say to that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know how ’tis!” said Sid wearily. “His
head’s sure stuffed with grandiose dreams! I ought
to look at it in a big way, he says. Scotty thinks
he’s a millionaire already. He talks about buying
the tribe a great reservation somewhere, as if
Honanta’d agree even to that. What he wants is
just peace—and isolation. Nowhere else would his
people be free from corruption by every white rapscallion
who roams the state. And what mining company
would agree to setting aside any sum to pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
them for this place? Isn’t it Scotty’s already, by
his mere act of driving in a few pegs?”</p>

<p>“Sho!” sighed Big John, sinking back again with
weakness. The problem seemed too tough for him.
After a silence his voice came dreamily from the
cot. “Gold! Sometimes, Sid, I think—our laws
are—all wrong,” gasped Big John. “No other race
but ours—permits one man—to own these big—nat’ral
products—that ought to belong to the—hull
country—while thousands of us—starve. ’Tain’t
right—son! ’Tain’t right!”</p>

<p>His voice relapsed in utter weariness. Sid went
out of the lodge, regretting that his own impetuosity
had brought this miserable problem to Big John
at such a time.</p>

<p>Honanta met him at the doorway: “Can your
big white friend speak?” he whispered eagerly.</p>

<p>Sid wanted to kick himself for remorse! He had
forgotten to ask Big John the most important question
of all—what had become of Hano. Now it
might be too late. The chief’s eyes told him of the
long anxious strain of waiting his Indian friend had
been through. Honanta had not slept during the
night. A small group of braves, armed for the trail
and each carrying a bag of pinole at his hip, told him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
that the search party was here, ready to go after
Hano.</p>

<p>He and Honanta reëntered the medicine lodge and
stood for some time silent and watchful. The still
form of the patient moved not. Finally he turned
over, the lines of irksome pain seaming his hawklike
face. Slowly his eyes opened and fixed themselves
on Sid. Then they turned on Honanta and studied
him awhile.</p>

<p>“Whar’d ye git <i>him</i>, Sid?” asked Big John slowly.</p>

<p>“Hano’s father, Honanta, the man whose arrow
saved you, John. Can you tell where you saw Hano
last?”</p>

<p>“Shore! He was fannin’ out through the Notch
on yore pony, Sid. One jump ahead of a posse of
greasers. Headed—he seemed to me, for Camino
del Diablo,” said Big John, and again his eyes
closed.</p>

<p>Honanta faced Sid, his eyes gleaming with triumph.
“It is good! My son gave himself to lead
the enemy away from our home! He has done
well,” he whispered. “Come! We go.”</p>

<p>Out in the fearful sand dunes to the north rode
Sid and Honanta with a few of the Apaches.
Mounts there were for them all, for Scotty had found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
their own ponies unmolested and a few of the Mexican
horses had been caught. It was a dead and desolate
region, with scowling black mountains all about
and the sand burying them high up on their flanks.
Into this waste Hano had ridden, the flying hoofs
of the guerrillas following him as the spurted sand
tracks showed. On and on after these tracks
Honanta’s party plodded. There was no water here,
no vegetation, nothing. By midday they had followed
the trail north toward the Camino del Diablo.</p>

<p>Then a cry came from Sid, for far beyond he had
spied a lone, low object lying on the stony waste.
Empty cartridges lying along the route told that the
guerrillas had begun to shoot here. Riding nearer,
the object developed into a horse, lying dead and
swollen in the sun. Sid gritted his teeth, for it was
his own pony.</p>

<p>“Poor Pinto! They must have shot him at long
range. Here are Hano’s moccasin prints, though,
running.”</p>

<p>Honanta looked down at them in silent musing.
Then his eyes swept on ahead. Flying like a deer,
Hano had led them on until he had gained the shelter
of some distant rocks, the beginning of the black,
bare, and waterless Tule Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>The party rode on. Soon the horse tracks
showed that the guerrillas had given him up. They
could do nothing in the rocks with this Indian, and
being on the wrong side of the border evidently had
not been at all to their liking. In a sudden turn
they had swept off down the Camino del Diablo
toward Represa Tanks.</p>

<p>“I take it they’ll all go back to Mexico, Honanta,”
said Sid. “They saw nothing of Red Mesa, and I
think we’ve seen the last of <i>them</i>.”</p>

<p>Honanta shrugged his shoulders: “My Hano!
We must follow on!” he urged.</p>

<p>The Apaches now dismounted and began tracking.
But, once in the rocks, Hano had been too
keen even for them. Not a further trace could be
found. He might have gone anywhere, and wider
and wider circles came across not a single footprint.</p>

<p>“Gee! I wish we’d brought Ruler!” exclaimed
Sid, vexedly. “Scotty has him to-day, trying to
track Vasquez. While that scoundrel is at large
nothing is safe.”</p>

<p>Honanta seemed relieved. “My son is safe!” he
declared. “He’ll reach Tule Tanks where there is
water at this time of the year. Fear not! He will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
return some day. We go back to Red Mesa and
keep watch.”</p>

<p>It was evening before they rode up that vast sandy
valley headed by the lava apron which flowed out
of Red Mesa standing high on the mountain like
some medieval cathedral. Up on its brink Sid noted
a brush shade with a figure lying under it. A hand
rose and waved down to them as they dismounted
and tethered the horses where there was feed.</p>

<p>“Good old John—he’s had his own way!” laughed
Sid. “On the job again! Must be getting better,
all right. Those are wonderful herbs of yours,
chief!”</p>

<p>He found that Scotty had already returned with
Ruler. The intercourse between the two chums was
now strained and lacked their usual cordial affection,
but Sid learned that the dog had been able
to track “that Vasquez,” as Big John called him,
over the mountain and out into the Pass, where he
had captured a stray horse and ridden off southwards.</p>

<p>“That means he’ll spend the night at Papago
Tanks,” concluded Scotty. “If we get up a party
to go there to-night, we’ll take him.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” retorted Sid. “To-night’s the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
night he’ll attempt something against us, don’t you
worry! We’ve got to stay here, on guard, and keep
a sharp lookout on the cave mouth.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Scotty, mystified at Sid’s words.</p>

<p>“The fellow brought dynamite, sure as we stand
here, Scotty. He could lock us <i>all</i> up in Red Mesa
if he could shatter our cave with a stick of it.
That’s the only entrance, and the walls are unscalable.”</p>

<p>Scotty looked surprised. “By George, that’s
so!” he exclaimed at length, nervously.</p>

<p>He fell silent, and Sid could see that his engineer’s
mind was already at work planning some
scheme to build a way out in case Vasquez should
succeed. They both went over to where Big John
lay with Blaze beside him. The big cowman’s eyes
were bright, and he greeted them cheerily.</p>

<p>“You-all give this old bird plenty of corn pone
and Montana chicken (bacon), an’ he’ll surprise ye,
boys!” he chirped. “Ain’t no one goin’ to pull no
Enchanted Mesa stuff on us while the old meat
gun’s handy!” He reached down his hand to where
the .35 lay on the rock beside him. “This-yer’s a
good job! Pretty soft! Hed a swell time persuadin’
them Injuns to fix me up hyar, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“We’ll stay here to-night, too, John,” said Sid.
“A few extra rifles on watch won’t hurt.”</p>

<p>Far below the location of the cave mouth showed
as a mere black crease in the lava as seen from their
vantage point. Apache scouts were on guard there,
Sid knew, but a stealthy creep, a sudden rush in the
dark, the hurling of a bundle of dynamite sticks they
could not prevent. Only keen eyesight and the alert
senses of a dog could give warning.</p>

<p>He suggested to Scotty to take Ruler down
there, which the other was not slow to do, for Scotty
acted nervous and constrained as if his conscience
troubled him. He, too, was fighting a battle with
himself—and apparently he dreaded the recommencement
of any argument over the Red Mesa mine, for
the meaning of this place was slowly growing on
him. Yet it was hard to give up wealth, a career,
success as a mining engineer—for an ideal!</p>

<p>The Apaches went through their usual sunset worship
that evening. It filled Sid with a mournful
regret. If only this life of theirs could go on unmolested!
But it would be impossible, unless some
great change were to come over Scotty. You could
not change people! They were what they were.
Scotty meant well; his point of view was the usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
thing. The mine belonged to him and to Sid; the
Indians they could provide for elsewhere, buy a
reservation for them in a far better locality than
this—nothing to it!</p>

<p>But Sid knew that the problem went deeper than
that. Its isolation was the real value of this place, its
real importance to the Indians. Nowhere else would
they be free from contact with the whites; nowhere
else be free from the inevitable temptations of civilization.
Honanta would look at it that way, Sid
knew, if all the ins and outs of this situation were to
be explained to him, and he would never consent to
his band leaving Red Mesa for any exchange whatever.</p>

<p>Later the girl Nahla came to Sid and he was able
to comfort her with news of Hano. That he had
not broken his honor but instead had risked his life
for the tribe and made a splendid coup thereby, Sid
could see filled her with a rapture that only he could
appreciate. She left him, singing softly a prayer
of thanksgiving to the Great Mystery, and Sid went
on with his watch.</p>

<p>All the desert lay silent and grand and mysterious
under the slow-moving stars as he kept his vigil,
ruminating over it all. He wished that his father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Colonel Colvin, could be brought here. Honanta
would do whatever those wise old gray hairs thought
best. Honanta owed to Colonel Colvin his life, and
to an Indian that debt is never paid. There <i>must</i>
be a good way out of all this. Colonel Colvin, with
his wide knowledge of Indian affairs and his broad
sympathies, was the man to point it out.</p>

<p>It was somewhere in the dread hours of the dead
of night when the dog Blaze whined softly and Sid
could see that he was peering downward, his ears
cocked to alert attention. Sid followed the line of
his gaze as best he could. Over there near the base
of the mountain there was—something! No man
in his senses would attempt to climb over that mountain
in the dark through all its bristly cactus and
choyas, Sid reflected. The only practicable route
would be along its base, where the sand would deaden
hoofbeats and a man could approach unseen.</p>

<p>But an Airedale can see in the dark far better
than humans, better even than a hound. Ruler had
given no sign below, but Blaze had evidently become
suspicious. Nature had not given him the hound’s
nose, but she had compensated by an eyesight equal
to a cat’s.</p>

<p>A faint grunt came from Big John as his hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
crept down to the rifle below the cot. “Watch yoreself,
Sid! Blazie boy, he sees somethin’ out thar
an’ don’t ye ferget it!” he warned. “That Vasquez
is comin’, shore as shootin’.”</p>

<p>Sid strained his eyes. The blackness of the valley
was impenetrable. Once a shock of alarm thrilled
through him as a low humped object, half discerned
in the black shadows of the mountain base, seemed
not where it was when he had last tried to make it
out but nearer. But as he looked the blurred form
appeared stationary, immovable as one of the
boulders. Yet, after a time, when his eyes grew
fatigued with the strain, it was gone!</p>

<p>Instantly he raised his rifle and an impulse to give
the alarm overpowered him. But he stifled it, peering
with all his might. Better let Vasquez come
nearer than frighten him off now, otherwise, it would
all have to be repeated later.</p>

<p>A brooding stillness kept up. The far-off howls
of coyotes came from over the mountains where
they were no doubt fighting over the carcasses of
those slaughtered sheep. None were around here,
with that ghastly feast spread. Sid waited for he
know not what to develop, finger on trigger, hand
on Blaze’s back to quiet the eager dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>Then a hoarse growl rumbled in Blaze’s furry
throat! He rose unsteadily to his feet and a bitter
snarl bared his teeth. Some unfamiliar taint in the
air had now come to his nostrils. Sid looked down
alert, finger on trigger. A movement on the cot
told him that Big John, too, had picked up the .35
and was peering keenly below. But they could see
nothing. Nothing moved. All the slope and the
sands below it was as silent and inscrutable as death.</p>

<p>Then a throaty bellow came from Ruler below. A
bow twanged in the darkness, and there came the
noise of a sudden rush of blurred forms in the night.
Big John turned half on his side and his rifle rose.</p>

<p>“Gosh, fer a light!” Sid heard him mutter.</p>

<p>Ruler’s challenging bark was roaring out now.
The dog had rushed down the slope. And, as if to
answer Big John, the sudden flare of a watch-fire
sprang up.</p>

<p>It showed the Apaches crouching and shooting
their arrows—but it showed also a figure in a flying
serapé climbing rapidly up the cleft toward the cave
mouth. A sputtering fire shot out sparks; then, as
the bellowing roar of Big John’s .35 rent the night,
there came a sizzling arc of fire, followed at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
by the tremendous, shattering detonation of dynamite!</p>

<p>Red Mesa rocked to its foundations. A long-drawn
subterranean moan came from the bowels of
the rocks, a growl like a distant thunder—then silence!
Sid had gotten one glimpse of a man being
blown to bits in the white glare of that explosion
which seemed to spew cannonlike out of the bowels
of the mountain, then his eyes saw nothing, blinded
for an instant by the intensity of it.</p>

<p>“Yah! Greaser!” gritted Big John’s voice in rising
intensity of feeling. “Ye done it—curse ye!”
Then Sid heard him fall back with a weary, hopeless
sigh.</p>

<p>Pitchy darkness! a dreadful, tense and tragic silence!
a stunning, appalling silence, wherein all the
world held its breath and Sid on the ledge felt his
senses grow numb before the portentous import of
it! Had Vasquez succeeded?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

OUT OF THE DESERT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Sid’s scattered wits returned to connected
thought, after the first few moments
following that stunning detonation,
his mind and his hopes went out first to Scotty.
How <i>could</i> he and the Apaches down there have
survived, right in the storm center of that explosion?
For a time he dared not even call out, nor was there
the least sound of human beings alive down there to
reassure him. Not even a faint groan came up to
his listening ears.</p>

<p>Still there was at least a ray of hope. That white
glare of the explosion had come out like the flare
from the mouth of a cannon. The tunnel, in fact,
<i>was</i> a vast stone cannon. Vasquez, true to Sid’s
diagnosis of the Latin mind, had planned his coup
logically, had thrown the bundle of dynamite sticks
fair and true right into the mouth of the cave where
it would do the most damage. But he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
reckoned on the laws of mechanics, the immutable
principles of action and reaction. For the forces of
that explosion had blown right back upon him who
had thrown the charge. It had rent him to bits,
and Sid had seen enough to be sure that the victim
had been the rash Vasquez himself.</p>

<p>Was there not a hope, then, that Scotty and the
Apaches, standing to one side of the direct blast,
had survived it? A man can stand near the muzzle
of a twelve-inch naval gun and yet not be hurt, beyond
the temporary shock to ears and nerves.</p>

<p>In spite of the appalling stillness which kept up,
Sid found courage at last to call out.</p>

<p>“Scotty! Leslie, old chum!—Are you still alive?”
his voice quavered out into the night.</p>

<p>There was a moment of anxious waiting. Then:
“Hi!—Don’t worry, Sid! We’re all right!” called
up Scotty’s voice in a peculiar dead inflection, for
his ears were evidently numb. “The thing went off
like a cannon. Only Vasquez himself, who was in
the direct line of it, got killed. We’re all shaken
up some, but nothing serious.”</p>

<p>Sid whooped with joy. Never till then did he
realize how deep was his affection for Scotty—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
enduring bond that a mere temporary difference
could affect only superficially.</p>

<p>“The cave mouth’s shattered, but I think we can
pick it loose,” came Scotty’s voice more strongly
after a time.</p>

<p>Presently the watch-fire flared up again and there
came sounds of men heaving and working and the
crash of stones tumbling down the lava apron.</p>

<p>Then: “Yeaay—Sid!... Listen! She’s all
right! She’s clear! I’m coming right up!” yelled
Scotty’s voice, and there were muffled voices of men
entering the cave.</p>

<p>Honanta and Scotty joined them on the apron
ledge shortly after. Sid felt a deep restful sense of
thankfulness now that it was all over. The menace
of starvation for Red Mesa was gone; Vasquez, the
only other person who knew about the mine, could
do no more harm. He wanted to sleep now, and
sleep well. After that, a last appeal to Scotty in
which Big John, he was sure, would join him.
After mutual congratulations had been exchanged
he got his bed roll and laid it out beside Big John’s
cot, thoroughly tired and relaxed. The cowman was
sleeping peacefully. After that glad hail of Scotty’s,
Nurse Nature had claimed him immediately!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>It was not until morning that the real disaster
to Red Mesa became known. A cry from one of the
squaws awoke Sid. He rolled sleepily out of his
blankets, to find her pointing excitedly at the lava
basin of the tank. It was half empty!</p>

<p>Down at least six feet below the rim was now
the level of the water, as Sid stared at it unbelievingly.
It was all too cruel to sense at first; too
great an irony of fate for the human mind to comprehend.
But, after the first interval of stupefaction,
Sid understood what had happened. That explosion
had opened a fissure in the lava bottom of
the tank—and Red Mesa was slowly bleeding to
death! A rush to the rim of the basin confirmed it.
There, down along one edge of the apron, a thin
trickle of water was flowing silent, unceasingly
sapping away the life blood of his ideal Indian community,
giving their precious indispensable water
to those thirsty sands of the desert drinking it up
far below!</p>

<p>What a thing is puny man! Armed with the unlimited
strength of dynamite, <i>one man</i> had done all
this; destroyed at a blow all living things that flourished
here, upset the huge yet delicate balance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Nature, driven into a wandering exile a once happy
people.</p>

<p>A great sob rose in Sid’s throat as what all this
meant came over him in an overwhelming wave of
emotion. What Scotty <i>might</i> have done in leading
here the slow advance of civilization, that villain
Vasquez had brought about in one mad moment of
callous cupidity. Sid ground his teeth in helpless
rage. Then he turned and raced for Scotty’s bunk
up near the mine. He, the engineer—he could stop
this catastrophe if any one could!</p>

<p>Already, as he passed, he could see the bottom of
the tank, dim and muddy below the fast vanishing
level of the water. Around its edges Apache women
were wailing and wringing their hands, some drawing
water while any yet remained. Honanta and
his braves had gathered and stood looking down at
the tank in stolid perplexity, helpless, knowing not
how or why this cruel thing was happening, nor
what to do.</p>

<p>“Wake, Scotty! Quick! Our water’s all going
from the tank! Help us, old man—hurry!” shouted
Sid wildly, shaking him.</p>

<p>Scotty sat up, and immediately his eyes fell on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
water level, now far down in the lava basin, the
pool itself shrunk to half its normal size.</p>

<p>“That explosion must have cracked a fissure open
somewhere, last night,” said Sid. “Only look, Les!”
he groaned.</p>

<p>Scotty pulled on his boots rapidly. “No use trying
to stop it from below, Sid,” he declared with the
sure knowledge of the engineer. “The water head
would burst any dam we could build down there.
We’ve got to find the crack in the bottom up here
and stop it. All hands into the tank!” he cried
energetically.</p>

<p>Sid waved his arm to Honanta and his bucks to
jump in and join in the search for the leak, but they
stood back, arms folded, eying him gloomily.
Childlike, in many ways, is the Indian mind! Before
anything whose cause they cannot reason out
they stand helpless. Only Niltci followed Sid and
Scotty into the water, and that from blind obedience.</p>

<p>“Hunt for a hole in the tank bottom, Niltci!—Hunt
for all your worth!” ordered Sid, handing
him a stick as they waded about the pool. Its water
was now less than three feet deep, the bottom smooth
and slippery with mud. Somewhere down there a
crevice, maybe only an inch wide, was drawing down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
the water—but where! The bottom was smooth and
hard as flint; nowhere did the searching sticks find
any crack that had no bottom.</p>

<p>Scotty’s face grew more and more concerned as
they reached the end of the tank away from the lava
outflow. Here it grew deeper and the bottom was
all ragged pot holes of scoriated lava. Here gases
had forced their way out from below while yet the
molten stuff was soft. His stick felt down into
deep jagged holes and could tell him nothing as to
whether a fissure existed at the bottom of them or
not.</p>

<p>In spite of his forced air of cheerfulness the outlook
grew more and more hopeless. Somewhere
down here was the leak, but where? Finally he
came to a deep jagged pot-hole which swallowed his
stick and more—down to the limit of his armpits.
He sent Niltci for a pole, his face drawn with
anxiety, for failure as an engineer, utter and complete,
was now staring him in the face. When it
arrived it went down into that pot-hole its full
depth, to touch only ragged scoriations of lava, at
the bottoms of any one of which might be the
fissure.</p>

<p>“Sid, we’re done!” cried Scotty, hopelessly, tears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
starting from his eyes. “Only concrete and lots
of it can fix this! Oh, Sid, I’d give anything in the
world to be able to help them!” wept Scotty, prodding
futilely with his pole in a mechanical effort to
relieve the stress in his mind. “They must all go!
All this must die!”—waving his arm around at the
green and flowering things that made the valley
gracious. “You were right, Sid! This is the object
lesson I needed—gorry, but I needed it in all
my visionary pride! This is what I would have
done to Honanta’s people, only in another way. The
pity of it! I see it now—I don’t <i>want</i> their mine—at
such a price!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there anything we can <i>do</i>?” barked Sid
rebelliously. “Throw in rocks—dirt—skins—<i>anything</i>
to stop it!”</p>

<p>Scotty shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>“We’d be too late—look at the water now!”</p>

<p>At once the hopelessness of it all overtook even
Sid’s buoyant nature. The water was now only
two feet deep and a wide area of glistening mud
swept down from the brink. The edges of it had
already dried in the desert air.</p>

<p>Sid waded out and faced Honanta, shaking his
head solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“My son, why did the white man do this cruel
thing?” asked the chief, his deep voice filled with
gentle rebuke. “My people must wander forth, now—I
know not where.”</p>

<p>“Because he wanted your mine, Honanta!” gritted
Sid passionately, over the injustice of it all. “To
get it for himself he hoped to lock us all up here,
to die of starvation, like the people of the Enchanted
Mesa. And now look how it has turned
out! I stand here—ashamed, Honanta—ashamed
of my race!”</p>

<p>“<i>Take</i> your mine! It is always so when the white
man finds gold! All this must die! The red man
must go!”</p>

<p>“No!” barked Scotty wildly through his tears.
“No, chief! You won’t have to go! Concrete can
fix it! As soon as the water is gone we shall get at
the crack and seal it. We’ll mend the basin and then
leave you in peace forever. I promise it, here and
now! Never, never shall any mention of your mine
cross my lips!”</p>

<p>“My son, many, many rains it took to fill that
tank! My people were careful to use each year no
more than the Great Mystery saw fit to send us. We
have done no wrong, yet is the face of the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Mystery hid behind a cloud. We must go forth!”
sighed Honanta.</p>

<p>He turned to his old men and gave an order.
Immediately the whole village became the scene of
busy preparations for the march. Sid watched them
with tears in his eyes, while Scotty protested vainly
to Honanta. Where could they go? To Tinajas
Atlas, perhaps, there to hide in some rocky fastness
of the desert, forced to fetch water from long distances
and sooner or later to be discovered at the
tank by our border rangers, rounded up and sent
back to the reservation.</p>

<p>It must not be! He and Scotty had brought all
this upon them; it was their responsibility to see to
it that another and a better home should be found
for them. Perhaps Scotty was right, in the long
run. If they could retain control of this mine and
operate it successfully, there would be money enough
to repay Honanta forever.</p>

<p>By noon the village reported ready for the march.
Men, women, and children, they would go forth on
foot into the pitiless desert, and somehow, through
untold sufferings, incredible endurance, would make
that march to a new home—but it could never, never,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
approach the freedom and peace of this spot, the
Arms of the Great Mystery!</p>

<p>Towards its high red walls Honanta now raised
his hands in silent prayer and farewell. Soon it
would become a sun-baked, scorched, arid ruin, the
home of saguarro and choya, a place that no one
but white men would want. With its empty, bare
and mud-caked basin, that once held smiling and
life-giving water—Red Mesa was dead.</p>

<p>Sid looked on, so overcome with sympathy that
he had not given their own problems a thought.
Yet, with the last of the water, they too would face
the pitiless scourge of thirst. Big John would have
to be moved to Papago Tanks, somehow. But all
that could wait.</p>

<p>“Good-by, white boy!” said Honanta, coming up
to grip his hand strongly. “Tell your father that,
some day, I will visit him—when my people are
provided for.”</p>

<p>He turned to give the order to march.</p>

<p>Who sneers at coincidences? They happen to us
daily, in those abrupt meetings of chance whose
obscure workings of cause and effect we know nothing
of, nor can trace. One happened now; for, as
Honanta had raised his head to give the order, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
that instant there came a hail from Big John on
his cot on the apron brink.</p>

<p>“Hi, Sid!—Say!—Hyar comes yore <i>daddy</i>!—An’
that Apache feller!” he sang out. For a moment
Sid stood looking at him in sheer amazement. Had
Big John gone delirious? How and why had Colonel
Colvin come here? But if it was really, truly so——</p>

<p>“Wait, Honanta! Wait!—You <i>shall</i> see my
father, and your own son, sooner than any of us
expected!—Wait!” cried Sid, running after the chief
to seize his arm.</p>

<p>With Sid, unable to comprehend how or why his
father could actually be here, they went together
along the empty tank to the apron brim.</p>

<p>But it was true! Down there on the sands of the
valley two riders were coming, and Honanta gave
a great cry as his keen eyes recognized the smaller
of the two.</p>

<p>“Hano!—My son! My <i>son</i>!” he yelled, his stoic
Indian reserve broken down by the intensity of the
moment.</p>

<p>Sid waved energetically to the other rider whose
thick-set figure told that he was an older man, undoubtedly
Colonel Colvin himself.</p>

<p>Presently a hail came from them both, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the younger man led on, showing the older one how
to reach the cave mouth. After a tense, excited interval
of waiting Colonel Colvin issued out of the
medicine lodge and ran toward Sid. Hano stood by
the lodge, the girl Nahla already passionately clinging
to him. Honanta stalked toward his son as all
the tribe stood by and watched.</p>

<p>“Gad!—Sid, my boy, we’ve had <i>some</i> ride!” burst
out Colonel Colvin bluffly, as Sid went to his arms
and Scotty gripped at his extended hand. “This
Apache boy, Hano, found me at the ranch and told
me you-all were in trouble. Seems that he escaped
from some Mexicans out of the desert and reached
the railroad at Tacna. There he sold all he had and
bought a ticket to our station, Colvin’s, on the main
line. ‘Knew my name, long time’ is all I could get
out of him. But it was plain enough that you were
in trouble down here and he wanted me to come
quickly, so we took the train to the Ajo Mines,
bought horses and rode here.—Hey! What the nation’s
the matter with our John?” he broke off suddenly
as his eyes fell on the occupant of the cot.</p>

<p>“Oh, I jest nat’rally stopped a leetle lead in a
fight we had with the greasers hyarabouts, Colonel,”
grinned Big John. “Jest hed to, sir!—Them durned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
boys won’t be satisfied till they kills this ole puncher,
nohow, I’m thinkin’!” he grimaced whimsically.
“Lots doin’ ’round hyar, Colonel! Let them boys
tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>He sank back happily while Sid told him the
whole story of the Red Mesa plaque, of the trip to
Pinacate and then of Vasquez’s diabolical attempt
and the consequent loss of all their water.</p>

<p>Colonel Colvin listened sympathetically. Before
Sid had finished he felt a touch on his elbow and
turned to find Honanta facing him.</p>

<p>“Does my white father remember the massacre
of Apache Cave—and this?” the chief asked, his
voice vibrating with emotion as his hand touched the
gold double eagle dangling on his chest.</p>

<p>“Yes—a bitter memory, chief!” replied Colonel
Colvin. “The Army does not talk of it much.
Curious!” he exclaimed, looking at the coin and
evidently searching back in his memory. “Why, I
was in that fight myself!—I remember that coin—or
a piece just like it—I gave one to a poor squaw
whom we found badly wounded with a baby in her
arms. She was the only one left alive in all those
heaps of slain Apaches. Gad, but that massacre was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
a devilish piece of business for the Army to have to
do!”</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> that baby, my white father!” said Honanta,
drawing himself up dramatically. “The sole living
survivor of Apache Cave—and unconquered! My
heart told me that this young man, whose name was
also Colvin”—indicating Sid—“was your son.
Therefore I spared him, when my old men advised
that he be slain, since he had discovered this our
refuge.”</p>

<p>He waved a fringed arm around at the mighty
walls of Red Mesa. “This was our home!” he
declaimed. “No more! The white man came, and
he took our water. All of it! Our home is dead.
We must go!”</p>

<p>“Where <i>will</i> you go, chief?” asked the Colonel,
eying Honanta keenly.</p>

<p>“I know not,” said Honanta, wearily. “Somewhere
out into the desert, where my people can find
peace again.”</p>

<p>“Listen, chief!” said Colonel Colvin earnestly.
“Where I live is called the Grand Cañon of the Gila.
Your people knew it well, once. High above us
towers a mighty peak, all orange in the glow of the
sun, and across it a great band of pure white. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
peak you have heard of, I know, chief!” declared
Colonel Colvin, and Honanta nodded in confirmation.
“In the valley of our river are timbered ranges,
where deer and bear and turkey run wild and trout
fill the streams. Across from us are steep precipices
along which leads the old Apache Trail—the home
of your fathers, chief. I own much land there,
plenty for all of us. This mine the boys tell me of
in your Red Mesa will buy more. If that golden
double eagle means any obligation to you, chief, will
you come to my place with your whole band—there
to live as did your fathers?”</p>

<p>Honanta hesitated. His eyes beamed with pleasure,
yet a troubled, doubtful expression in them told
Sid that he was wondering how long our government
would let them stay there. Better than the reservation
the freedom of the desert!</p>

<p>“That orange mountain was once a sign of the
Great Mystery to your people, chief,” went on the
Colonel, his voice still more persuasive and compelling.
“It stands there yet, a sign that His ways
are unchanging, His mercy everlasting. Come!
There is room there for all of us!—and I will see
to it myself that our government grants you freedom—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
it has already done for the Mohave
Apaches.”</p>

<p>Honanta’s eyes widened at that last! It was news
to him that the policy of our government had in any
way liberalized! Then he stretched out his hand,
his eyes glowing.</p>

<p>“My white father is kind! He is noble-hearted
and just!” he exclaimed. “Would that he and my
own father, Chief Chuntz, had known each other
otherwise than over a rifle barrel! I owe you my
life, Colonel Colvin; you have brought me back my
son. I thank the Great Mystery that He whispered
in my heart to spare yours! In the name of my
people, I accept your offer, Colonel, gratefully!”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the bluff old colonel, heartily,
as their hands clasped.</p>

<p>One by one, family by family, the Apaches bade
farewell to their homes and then descended the cave
tunnel. A procession followed made up of Sid and
Scotty, Colonel Colvin and Niltci, carrying Big John
on an improvised stretcher. Two horses with the
Colonel and Sid riding them, bore a pole litter for
Big John thereafter; the rest were laden with every
jar of water the Apaches possessed. And so the
cavalcade set forth north into the desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>Sid turned to look back for the last time at Red
Mesa. High and lifted up, its walls rose in huge
flanks out of the mountain side, glaring in the burning
sun. Soon there would be no life there, no
luxuriant roothold for green living plants, no happy
home for a simple people. When Scotty got his company
organized—and he <i>did</i>, in due time, but that is
beyond the province of this story—there would be
a scene of sweating activity there, ore cars coming
and going, men and burros toiling, the great tank
repaired and giving water to them all.</p>

<p>But Sid did not want to think of that. Rather
he would like always to remember it as the one place
he knew where once Indians had lived as their forefathers
had, long before the white man came—in
simple, reverent faith in the Great Mystery, in the
simple needs of a free people, in the simple, sure, old
foundations of Indian morality—Courage, Honor,
Truth, Chastity.</p>

<p>Three days later they reached Ajo Mines. The
company lent the Colonel a train of empty ore cars
and the railroad took them to the main line. Thence
the Colonel led Honanta and his people to a land of
mighty mountain ranges, of green alfalfa fields
strung along a rushing river dominated by beetling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
crags, of herds of fat cattle grazing in a land of
plenty. And here, under the protection of the name
Colvin, in the timbered hills of their forefathers,
Honanta and the Yellow Bear clan of the Apache
at last found peace.</p>
